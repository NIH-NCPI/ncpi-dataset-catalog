    "description": "<p>The ARRA Autism Sequencing Collaboration was created in 2010 bringing together expert large-scale sequencing center (at the Baylor College of Medicine, PI Richard Gibbs and the Board Institute of MIT and Harvard, PI Mark J. Daly) and a collaborative network of research labs focused on the genetics of autism (brought together by the Autism Genome Project and the Autism Consortium). These groups worked together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture of autism through comprehensive examination of the exotic sequence of all genes. The Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) was founded by Joseph D. Buxbaum and colleagues as an international group of scientists who share autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples and genetic data. The PIs are Drs. Joseph D. Buxbaum (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Mark J. Daly (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), Bernie Devlin (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine), Kathryn Roeder (Carnegie Mellon University, Matthew State and Stephan Sanders (University of California, San Francisco). The rationale for the ASC is described in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259942\">Buxbaum et al. 2012</a>, and this paper should be cited when referencing the data set. All shared data and analysis is hosted at a single site, which enables joint analysis of large-scale data from many groups. The ASC was first supported by a cooperative agreement grant to four lead sites funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH100233, U01MH100209, U01MH100229, U01MH100239), with additional support from the National Human Genome Research Institute. The NIMH recently renewed their support with a second grant (U01MH111661, U01MH111660, U01MH111658 and U01MH111662) to expand the project from 29,000 genomes to more than 50,000 exomes over the next 5 years. NHGRI provides ongoing sequencing support for the ASD through the Broad Center for Common Disease Genomics (UM1HG008895, Mark Daly, PI).</p>",

GTEx will create a database that researchers can use to study how inherited changes in genes lead to common diseases.</p>\n<p>GTEx researchers are studying genes in different tissues obtained from many different people. The GTEx project also includes a study of the GTEx donor consent process - this study will help ensure that the consent process and other aspects of the project effectively address the concerns and expectations of participants in the study. GTEx is a pioneering project that uses state-of-the-art protocols for obtaining and storing a large range of organs and tissues, and for testing them in the lab. Until now, no project has analyzed genetic variation and expression in as many tissues from the same person in such a large population as planned for GTEx.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Description</strong></p>\n<p>Understanding the role of variation in the human genome is crucial to elucidating genetic contributions to human health and disease. Despite the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) documenting strong statistical associations between genetic variation and human traits, the functional role for most of these variants is largely unexplained. Nearly 90% of these GWAS-implicated sites lie outside of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that these variants might regulate gene expression.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is to establish a resource database and tissue biobank in which to study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression and other molecular phenotypes in reference/non-diseased tissues. The ultimate resource will include approximately 960 post-mortem donors with several dozen tissues from each, a resource large enough to study both <em>cis</em>- and <em>trans</em>- gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Some tissue will also be banked for additional molecular analyses. To request biosamples, please see the <a href=\"http://www.gtexportal.org/home/samplesPage\">Biobank page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>GTEx was initially funded as a 2-year pilot project by the NIH Common Fund (CF) in 2010, and has been scaled up after demonstration of feasibility. The project will collect and analyze RNA levels in many different human tissues and each donor will be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping arrays and sequencing of either whole exomes or whole genomes.</p>\n<p>By treating RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, eQTLs will be identified as sites containing genetic variation that correlate with changes in RNA expression. Such eQTLs have been associated with 4%-12% of expressed human genes, and with common complex human diseases, including obesity, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Crohn's disease, and asthma. Additionally, few studies have examined the tissue specificity of eQTLs. A subset of banked tissue samples will also be analyzed for other molecular phenotypes, such as DNA methylation, DNaseI hypersensitivity sites, and proteomics. The GTEx project will thus serve as a resource database and tissue bank for many future studies, especially for understanding the functional basis of inherited susceptibility to disease.</p>\n<p>All GTEx releases since Version 5 follow the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy whereby there are no restrictions on use or publication after release. Additional information about the GTEx Data Release and Publication policy can be found on the GTEx Data Portal at <a href=\"http://www.gtexportal.org\">www.gtexportal.org</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>ClinSeq is a pilot project to investigate the use of whole-genome sequencing as a tool for clinical research. By piloting the acquisition of large amounts of DNA sequence data from individual human subjects, we are fostering the development of hypothesis-generating approaches for performing research in genomic medicine, including the exploration of issues related to the genetic architecture of disease, implementation of genomic technology, informed consent, disclosure of genetic information, and archiving, analyzing, and displaying sequence data. In the initial phase of ClinSeq, we are enrolling roughly 1000 participants; the evaluation of each includes obtaining a detailed family and medical history, as well as a clinical evaluation. The participants are being consented broadly for research on many traits and for whole-genome sequencing. Initially, Sanger-based sequencing of 300-400 genes thought to be relevant to atherosclerosis is being performed, with the resulting data analyzed for rare, high-penetrance variants associated with specific clinical traits. The participants are also being consented to allow the contact of family members for additional studies of sequence variants to explore their potential association with specific phenotypes. Here, we present the general considerations in designing ClinSeq, preliminary results based on the generation of an initial 826 Mb of sequence data, the findings for several genes that serve as positive controls for the project, and our views about the potential implications of ClinSeq. The early experiences with ClinSeq illustrate how large-scale medical sequencing can be a practical, productive, and critical component of research in genomic medicine.

Collection was initiated by ascertaining affected sib-pair families (both parents, two affected siblings and, when available, an unaffected sibling), collected from five geographic regions through four recruitment networks (Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America, United Kingdom). In addition, the T1DGC collected trio families (both parents and affected child) and cases and controls from low-prevalence populations (African-American, with four grandparents self-reporting as African ancestry; Mexican-American, with four grandparents self-reporting as ancestry from Mexico). The T1DGC also served as a repository for contributed collections from other studies, all meeting the broad data-sharing policy of the T1DGC, for inclusion in the genetic studies. These collections include T1D case samples ascertained from the UK Genetic Resource Investigating Diabetes (UK GRID) cohort, SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH), The Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD), and control samples obtained from the British 1958 Birth Cohort, the UK National Blood Services collection, CLEAR (Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African-Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis), the New York Cancer Project (NYCP), and other cohorts. For the NHGRI-funded Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) project, participants with T1D and ancestry-matched controls were identified through the T1DGC, either through direct ascertainment or by contribution from other sources to the T1DGC. As the CCDG has focused initially on non-Caucasian populations for whole genome sequencing, T1DGC participants of African, Mexican and Asian ancestry (targeting ~1200 cases and ~1200 controls in each ancestral group) and a small group of participants of Northern European ancestry (~100 cases, ~100 controls) were to be contributed to the study.

A total of 2,000 women who are 18 - 55 years of age and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 similarly aged men will be enrolled in this multi-site observational study from approximately 120 different hospitals across the country. Young women have a much greater risk of dying after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than similarly aged men. Their mortality risk is markedly higher than that of young men, and limited data on young minority women suggest that they may have the highest risk of any young subgroup. Findings from the small number of published studies of young women with ischemic heart disease suggest that the biology, epidemiology, care, and outcomes of this group are distinct from those of men. To date, there have been no large studies of this population, even as the death toll is comparable to that from breast cancer in this country. This study will help researchers identify key factors that influence recovery from a heart attack and potentially improve the care and outcomes of young women and men with AMI.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific Aims:</strong><br> To investigate the excess risk in young women with AMI and to identify key demographic, clinical, metabolic, psychosocial, health care delivery, and biological determinants of prognosis, we propose a national, prospective, observational study of 2,000 women who are 55 years or younger with AMI and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 men. Our prior work and preliminary studies indicate that the sex differences are most prominent in this age group and suggest that by 1 year after discharge, there are substantial sex differences in outcomes.

The driving principle behind the Epi25 Consortium is collaboration and synergy - it is only possible to achieve this type of research by working together. The Epi25 Consortium was formed by the unification of various consortia, including Epi4K, EPIGEN, EuroEPINOMICS, the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project, EpiPGX, SANAD, and EpiCURE, and individual epilepsy investigators. The consortium's sample collection is the best resource in the world for this disease, both in terms of numbers of patients and quality of phenotypic information.</p>\n<p>As part of the NHGRI Centers for Common Disease Genomics (2016-2020), we aggregated a global sample collection from the various repositories for whole genome genotyping and whole exome sequencing (WES) at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA), initiating the largest and most ethnically diverse genetic study of epilepsy to date. The primary epilepsy phenotypes for Epi25 are based on strict standards agreed upon by the epilepsy community. The epilepsy cases contributed by Epi25 sites can be broadly defined as genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), non-acquired focal epilepsy (NAFE), epileptic encephalopathies (EE), and lesional focal epilepsies. More information about eligibility criteria and phenotyping forms for Epi25, as well as the contributing centers, can be found here: <a href=\"http://epi-25.org/epi25-eligibility-criteria.\">epi-25.org</a> The genomic data will be analyzed iteratively to identify genes and variants that explain these types of epilepsy. Summary clinical data compiled in the Epi25 clinical database will allow retrospective phenotypic analyses of groups of subjects with common genomic variant(s). In v3 of this dbGaP study release, we are releasing CCDG-funded whole exome sequencing data from >30000 Epi25 samples and basic phenotype information such as epilepsy type.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Methylation of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides is an epigenetic mechanism with essential roles in mammalian development. To explore its functions in cellular differentiation, unbiased analysis of CpG methylation by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has been used to characterize epigenetic differences among different human tissues and cell types. Meanwhile, human interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is not cell-type specific has attracted relatively little attention. Systemic interindividual epigenetic variation is important, however, because like genetic variation it is a potential determinant of phenotypic variation and can be assessed in any easily obtainable DNA sample. Since systemic epigenetic variants originate in the preimplantation embryo, their establishment can be influenced by periconceptional environment, and potentially provide information about lifetime risks relevant to global health, obesity, and cancer.</p>\n<p>We elucidated systemic interindividual variation in CpG methylation in the human genome. We studied brain, heart, and thyroid tissues (representing all three germ layer lineages) from each of 10 donors in the NIH Gene-Tissue Expression (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424\">GTEx</a>) project. We performed deep whole genome bisulfite sequencing for these 30 samples, achieving a sequencing depth of over 50x coverage per sample. We identified 9,926 correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIVs). These regions, comprising just 0.1% of the human genome, often correlate with one another over long genomic distances, are associated with transposable elements and subtelomeric regions, conserved across various human ethnic groups, and particularly sensitive to periconceptional environment. While genetic variation appears to influence methylation at most CoRSIVs, many show no evidence of genetic influence, suggestive of 'pure' epigenetic variation. At CoRSIVs, interindividual variation in DNA methylation in an easily biopsied tissue predicts expression in other tissues, and genes associated with these loci are implicated in a range of human disorders. In addition to charting a previously unrecognized molecular level of human individuality, this atlas of human CoRSIVs provides a resource for future population-based investigations into how interindividual epigenetic variation modulates risk of disease.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Modern genetic studies have been conducted predominantly in cohorts of individuals of European ancestry. By 2010, there were approximately ten times as many published genome wide association studies (GWAS) in people of European ancestry than studies in people of all other ancestries combined. This research disparity has led to an uneven understanding of the genetic basis underlying disease in Europeans and non-Europeans. 23andMe's web-based, large scale research model is ideal for scaling genetics research within non-European populations and thereby bringing more parity to genetics research. Our database is composed of genotypes and phenotypes of over 1,000,000 consenting customers, including over 200,000 individuals with non-European ancestry. The data derived from non-European individuals represent a particularly valuable resource for genetic discovery of novel variants that may not be found in the European population. However, research studies in non-European populations are weakened by the lack of availability of large-scale reference datasets and, in particular, genotype imputation panels. Genotype imputation is a statistical methodology that uses observations of genotypes in a large reference panel to infer unobserved genotypes in a target dataset. This methodology is widely used within GWAS, and allows novel genetic associations to be identified and refined. Due to this utility, very large reference panels have been constructed, containing thousands or tens of thousands of whole genome sequences. Unfortunately, the largest imputation panels are composed of predominantly European genomes, reflecting the modern bias towards European studies in GWAS. This proposal aims to address this imbalance by constructing an imputation panel specifically for the African American population. In doing so, we will expand 23andMe's ability to perform genetic discovery in non-European populations, and improve the understanding of global genetic variation underlying diseases and traits. Key commercial outcomes of the research include the identification of novel genetic targets for internal and external therapeutic development. The long-term aim is to improve understanding of disease in minority populations, which we hope may eventually lead to improved treatments of disease in these historically medically understudied groups.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Startup of Framingham Heart Study.</strong> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p>\n<p>The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Design of Framingham Heart Study.</strong> In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants' adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study.</strong> Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study.</strong> While pursuing the Study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI's Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip.</p>\n<p><strong>Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data.</strong> The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies.

This project will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. <strong>The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.</strong> The initial phase of genome-wide association analysis included 500 COPD cases and 500 control subjects (all non-Hispanic White) genotyped with the Illumina Omni-1 chip.

    "description": "<p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI.</p>\n<p>The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide.</p>\n<p>The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:  - <strong>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)</strong>: This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. - <strong>Dietary Modification Trial (DM)</strong>: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. - <strong>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)</strong>: This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Observational Study (OS)</strong> examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Extension Studies</strong>: The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the first WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. Participants were invited again to participate in the second WHI Extension Study with continued follow up from 2010 to at least 2015. As of March 31, 2011 there were 93,122 women enrolled in the second extension.</p>\n<p>In Extension Study 2, the overall WHI study population was divided into two new subsamples, the Medical Records Cohort (MRC) and the Self-Report Cohort (SRC). The MRC consists of all former hormone trial participants and all African American and Hispanic participants from all study components. The SRC consists of the remaining participants. The extent of outcome information collected differs between the two cohorts, with more extensive outcomes information collection on the MRC.</p>\n<p>As part of Extension Study 2, selected older WHI participants were invited to participate in an In Person Visit (a.k.a., Long Life Study) at their homes during which additional blood samples were collected and various measurements were taken (such as blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, etc.).</p>\n<p>In October 2015, Extension Study 2 was renewed with continued follow-up planned through October 2020, pending annual contract review and renewal.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: The WHI website, <a href=\"https://www.whi.org/about/SitePages/About%20WHI.aspx\">https://www.whi.org/about/SitePages/About%20WHI.aspx</a> has much more information about the study.

    "description": "<p><strong>MESA</strong><br> The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.</p>\n<p>Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.</p>\n<p>In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>MESA Family</strong><br> The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the <strong>Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)</strong> and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping.</p>\n<p>The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.</p>\n<p><strong>MESA Air</strong><br> The general goal of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution ('MESA Air') is to prospectively examine the relation between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures (including PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multi-city, multi-ethnic cohort. MESA Air will also prospectively examine the relationship between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. MESA AIR is funded by a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the University of Washington and subcontracts from the UW to other participating institutions.</p>\n<p>MESA Air will assess if ambient air pollution is associated with changes over time in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial activation in a longitudinal data model, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and diet). The study will similarly assess if the incidence of cardiovascular events is associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, using a proportional hazards model. The study includes refinement of statistical tools, and explores joint/independent effects of acute and long-term pollutant exposure in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>The MESA Air study is built on the foundation of the ongoing MESA study. The parent MESA Study cohort is located in six geographic areas ('Field Centers') that capture tremendous exposure heterogeneity, comparable to or greater than the variability in locations of prior U.S. cohort studies. In addition to the six Field Centers, the study involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound and air pollution data.</p>\n<p>The cohort for the MESA Air study currently includes 6226 subjects: 5479 enrolled in the parent MESA study; 257 recruited specifically for this study, and 490 recruited from the MESA Family study. The entire MESA Air cohort will be followed over a 10-year project period for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events.</p>\n<p>On two occasions over the ten-year study period, 3600 subjects from the MESA Air cohort, residing in nine locales, will undergo computed tomography scanning to assess presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC), and ultrasound of the carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). We will also repeatedly assess plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial function in 720 subjects.</p>\n<p>MESA Air adds state-of-the-art air pollution exposure assessment information to the MESA cohort study, and introduces new subjects and outcome measures to achieve our aims. The study will assess long-term individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants for each subject using community-scale monitoring, outdoor spatial variation, subject proximity to pollution sources, pollutants' infiltration efficiency, and personal time-activity information. The exposure models will be validated using detailed monitoring in a subset of subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>The MESA Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.</strong> To view genotypes, analysis, expression data, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these substudies, please click on the following substudies below or in the \"Substudies\" section of this top-level study page phs000209 MESA Cohort.  - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000420\">phs000420</a> MESA SHARe - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000283\">phs000283</a> MESA CARe - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000403\">phs000403</a> MESA ESP Heart-GO</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Cleveland Family Study is the largest family-based study of sleep apnea world-wide, consisting of 2284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study was begun in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. NIH renewals provided expansion of the original cohort (including increased minority recruitment) and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. Index probands (n=275) were recruited from 3 area hospital sleep labs if they had a confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea and at least 2 first-degree relatives available to be studied. In the first 5 years of the study, neighborhood control probands (n=87) with at least 2 living relatives available for study were selected at random from a list provided by the index family and also studied. All available first degree relatives and spouses of the case and control probands also were recruited. Second-degree relatives, including half-sibs, aunts, uncles and grandparents, were also included if they lived near the first degree relatives (cases or controls), or if the family had been found to have two or more relatives with sleep apnea. Blood was sampled and DNA isolated for participants seen in the last two exam cycles (n=1447). The sample, which is enriched with individuals with sleep apnea, also contains a high prevalence of individuals with sleep apnea-related traits, including: obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and HTN.</p>\n<p>Phenotyping data have been collected over 4 exam cycles, each occurring ~every 4 years. The last three exams targeted all subjects who had been studied at earlier exams, as well as new minority families and family members of previously studied probands who had been unavailable at prior exams. Data from one, two, three and four visits are available for 412, 630, 329 and 67, participants, respectively. In the first 3 exams, participants underwent overnight in-home sleep studies, allowing determination of the number and duration of hypopneas and apneas, sleep period, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels; anthropometry (weight, height, and waist, hip, and neck circumferences); resting blood pressure; spirometry; standardized questionnaire evaluation of symptoms, medications, sleep patterns, quality of life, daytime sleepiness measures and health history; venipuncture and measurement of total and HDL cholesterol. The 4th exam (2001-2006) was designed to collect more detailed measurements of sleep, metabolic and CVD phenotypes and included measurement of state-of-the-art polysomnography, with both collection of blood and measurement of blood pressure before and after sleep, and anthropometry, upper airway assessments, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, and ECG performed the morning after the sleep study.</p>\n<p>Data have been collected by trained research assistants or GCRC nurses following written Manuals of Procedures who were certified following standard approaches for each study procedure. Ongoing data quality, with assessment of within or between individual drift, has been monitored on an ongoing basis, using statistical techniques as well as regular re-certification procedures. Between and within scorer reliabilities for key sleep apnea indices have been excellent, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) exceeding 0.92 for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep staging, assessed with epoch specific comparisons, also demonstrate excellent reliability for stage identification (kappas>0.82). There has been no evidence of significant time trends-between or within scorers- for the AHI variables. We also have evaluated the night-to-night variability of the AHI and other sleep variables in 91 subjects, with each measurement made 1-3 months apart. There is high night to night consistency for the AHI (ICC: 0.80), the arousal index (0.76), and the % sleep time in slow-wave sleep (0.73). We have demonstrated the comparability of the apnea estimates (AHI) determined from limited channel studies obtained at in-home settings with in full in-laboratory polysomnography. In addition to our published validation study, we more recently compared the AHI in 169 Cleveland Family Study participants undergoing both assessments (in-home and in-laboratory) within one week apart. These showed excellent levels of agreement (ICC=0.83), demonstrating the feasibility of examining data from either in-home or in-laboratory studies for apnea phenotyping. Data collected in the GCRC were obtained, when possible, with comparable, if not identical techniques, as were the same measures collected at prior exams performed in the participants' homes. To address the comparability of data collected over different exams, we calculated the crude age-adjusted correlations ~3 year within individual correlations between measures made in the most recent GCRC exam with measures made in a prior exam and demonstrated excellent levels of agreement for BMI (r=.91); waist circumference (0.91); FVC (0.88); and FEV1 (0.86). As expected due to higher biological and measurement variability, 149 somewhat lower 3-year correlations were demonstrated for SBP (0.56); Diastolic BP (0.48); AHI (0.62); and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (0.60).</p>\n<p><strong>NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.</strong> The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data will be created that includes records for approximately 50,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 1,200 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip will be conducted on approximately 9,500 African American participants drawn from the 50,000 participants in the nine cohorts.</p>\n<p><strong>Some relevant CARe publications</strong><br> CARe Study: PMID <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780\">20400780</a><br> CVD Chip Design: PMID <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833\">18974833</a></p>",

We hypothesize that other genes within these four pathways or within other pathways also are VTE disease-susceptibility genes. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) screen and analysis using the Illumina 660W platform to identify SNPs within 1,300 clinic-based, non-cancer VTE cases primarily from Minnesota and the upper Midwest USA, and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls frequency-matched on patient age, gender, myocardial infarction/stroke status and state of residence.</p>\n<p>This is a subset of a slightly larger candidate gene study using 1500 case-control pairs to identify haplotype-tagging SNPs (<strong>ht</strong>-SNPs) in a large set of candidate genes (n~750) within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Populations.</strong><br> <strong><u>Cases</u>.</strong> VTE cases were consecutive Mayo Clinic outpatients with objectively-diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) residing in the upper Midwest and referred by Mayo Clinic physician to the Mayo Clinic Special Coagulation Laboratory for clinical diagnostic testing to evaluate for an acquired or inherited thrombophilia, or to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center. Any person contacted to be a control but discovered to have had a VTE was evaluated for inclusion as a case. Cases were primarily residents from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, North or South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana. A DVT or PE was categorized as objectively diagnosed when (a) confirmed by venography or pulmonary angiography, or pathology examination of thrombus removed at surgery, or (b) if at least one non-invasive test (compression duplex ultrasonography, lung scan, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) was positive. A VTE was defined as:  - Proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which includes the common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, common femoral, superficial [now termed \"femoral\"] femoral, deep femoral [sometimes referred to as \"profunda\" femoral] and/or popliteal veins. (Note: greater and lesser saphenous veins, or other superficial or perforator veins, were not included as proximal or distal leg DVT). - Distal leg DVT (or \"isolated calf DVT\"), which includes the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peroneal veins. (Note: gastrocnemius, soleal and/or sural [e.g., \"deep muscular veins\" of the calf] vein thrombosis was not included as distal leg DVT). - Arm DVT, which includes the axillary, subclavian and/or innominate (brachiocephalic) veins. (Note: jugular [internal or external], cephalic and brachial vein thrombosis was not included in \"arm DVT\"). - Hepatic, portal, splenic, superior or inferior mesenteric, and/or renal vein thrombosis.

    "description": "<p>Analysis of the molecular etiologies of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) has led to important insights into the control of immune cell development. Most cases of SCID result from either X-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in a known causative gene. However, in some cases, the molecular etiology remains unclear. To identify the cause of SCID in a patient known to lack the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays and whole exome sequencing. The patient's mother was heterozygous for an inactivating mutation in <em>CD45</em>, while the paternal alleles lacked mutations. The patient exhibited a single <em>CD45</em> mutation identical to the maternal allele. Patient SNP array analysis revealed no change in copy number but loss of heterozygosity for the entire length of chromosome 1 (Chr1), indicating that disease was caused by uniparental disomy (UPD) with isodisomy of the entire maternal Chr1 bearing the <em>CD45</em> mutation. Non-lymphoid blood cells and other mesoderm and ectoderm-derived tissues retained UPD of the entire maternal Chr1 in this patient who had undergone successful bone marrow transplantation. Exome sequencing revealed mutations in 7 additional genes bearing nonsynonymous SNPs predicted to have deleterious effects. These findings represent the first reported case of SCID caused by UPD and suggest UPD should be considered in SCID and other recessive disorders, especially when the patient appears homozygous for an abnormal gene found in only one parent. Evaluation for alterations in other genes affected by UPD should also be considered in such cases.</p>",

Monogenic severe hypercholesterolemia is clinically characterized by elevated total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in plasma. Elevated LDL-cholesterol levels lead to excessive deposition of cholesterol in arterial walls, which eventually results in accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Monogenic hypercholesterolemia has a prevalence of approximately one in 500 individuals, making it one of the most common inherited disorders. To date, mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) ligand-binding domains of APOB and PCSK9 have been shown to cause hypercholesterolemia. While mutations in these genes can explain a large percentage of clinically diagnosed patients, the underlying molecular determinant in a substantial fraction of patients remains unknown.</p>\n<p>Familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (low HDL-C) is defined by an HDL-C below the age- and sex- specific 10th percentile.

The CFS was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on genetic and non-genetic risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In brief, the CFS is a family-based study that enrolled a total of 2284 individuals from 361 families between 1990 and 2006. The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first degree relatives, spouses and available second degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4 year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in the participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. The GCRC exam (n=735 selected individuals) included more comprehensive phenotype data on a focused subsample of the larger cohort, to permit linking SDB phenotypes with cardio-metabolic phenotypes, with an interest in identifying genetic loci that are associated with these related phenotypes. In this last round of data collection, a subset of 735 individuals was selected based on expected genetic informativity by choosing pedigrees where siblings had extremes of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Participants underwent detailed phenotyping including laboratory polysomnography (PSG), ECG, spirometry, nasal and oral acoustic reflectometry, vigilance testing, and blood and urine collection before and after sleep and after an oral glucose tolerance test. A wide range of biochemical measures of inflammation and metabolism were assayed by a Core Laboratory at the University of Vermont.</p>\n<p>994 individuals were sequenced as part of TOPMed Phase 1, including 507 African-Americans and 487 European-Americans.

The OOA population of Lancaster County, PA immigrated to the Colonies from Western Europe in the early 1700's. There are now over 30,000 OOA individuals in the Lancaster area, nearly all of whom can trace their ancestry back 12-14 generations to approximately 700 founders. Investigators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have been studying the genetic determinants of cardiometabolic health in this population since 1993. To date, over 7,000 Amish adults have participated in one or more of our studies.</p>\n<p>Due to their ancestral history, the OOA may be enriched for rare variants that arose in the population from a single founder (or small number of founders) and propagated through genetic drift. Many of these variants have large effect sizes and identifying them can lead to new biological insights about health and disease. The parent study for this WGS project provides one (of multiple) examples. In our parent study, we identified through a genome-wide association analysis a haplotype that was highly enriched in the OOA that is associated with very high LDL-cholesterol levels. At the present time, the identity of the causative SNP - and even the implicated gene - is not known because the associated haplotype contains numerous genes, none of which are obvious lipid candidate genes. A major goal of the WGS that will be obtained through the NHLBI TOPMed Consortium will be to identify functional variants that underlie some of the large effect associations observed in this unique population.</p>",

The JHS is a large, community-based, observational study whose 5306 participants were recruited from among the non-institutionalized African-American adults from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage (36.3%) of African Americans in the United States.</p>\n<p>The JHS design included participants from the Jackson ARIC study who had originally been recruited through random selection from a drivers' license registry. Approximately six months before the JHS was to begin, an amendment to the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act was passed that changed the level of consent for public release of personal information from driver's license lists from an \"opt out\" to an \"opt in\" basis. The Mississippi Highway Patrol was no longer able to release a complete listing of all persons with driver's licenses or state identification cards, which prevented its use in the JHS. New JHS participants were chosen randomly from the Accudata America commercial listing, which provides householder name, address, zip code, phone number (if available), age group in decades, and family components. The Accudata list was deemed to provide the most complete count of households for individuals aged 55 years and older in the Jackson MSA. A structured volunteer sample was also included in which demographic cells for recruitment were designed to mirror the eligible population. Enrollment was opened to volunteers who met census-derived age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) eligibility criteria for the Jackson MSA.</p>\n<p>In addition, a family component was included in the JHS. The sampling frame for the family study was a participant in any one of the ARlC, random, or volunteer samples whose family size met eligibility requirements. Eligibility included having at least two full siblings and four first degree relatives (parents, siblings, children over the age of 21) who lived in the Jackson MSA and who were willing to participate in the study. No upper age limit was placed on the family sample. Known contact information was obtained during the baseline clinic examination from the index family member with a verbal pedigree format to identify name(s), age(s), address (es), and telephone number(s). Recruitment was limited to persons 35-84 years old except in the family cohort, where those 21 years old and above were eligible. Only persons who otherwise met study criteria but were deemed to be physically or mentally incompetent by trained recruiters were excluded from study eligibility.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup> Wyatt SB, Diekelmann N, Henderson F, Andrew ME, Billingsley G, Felder SH et al.

We focus on asthma because of its public health significance.</strong> Asthma affects 26 million U.S. children and adults, remains a major cause of morbidity (one-half million hospitalizations a year) and is the most common cause of school and work days lost. Asthma-related costs are estimated to be over $12.7 billion annually. The Asthma Probands for both the extended pedigrees and the trios utilized in this study were selected on the basis of a physician diagnosis of asthma; a history of recurrent asthma attacks or at least 2 respiratory symptoms; and either airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine or significant response to bronchodilator (Albuterol) administration. These criteria are identical to the criteria used in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP).</p>\n<p><strong>The three primary goals of this project are to: (1) identify common and rare genetic variants that determine asthma and its associated phenotypes (height, weight, IgE level, lung function, bronchodilator response, steroid treatment response) through whole genome sequencing (WGS); (2) perform novel family based association analysis of our WGS data to identify novel genes for asthma; and (3) integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data with our WGS data and determine the epistatic interactions present using systems genomics approaches.</strong> Identification of the molecular determinants of asthma remains an important priority in translational science. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in this regard, identifying at least 10 novel susceptibility genes for asthma. However, as with most complex traits, the variants identified by GWAS explain only a fraction of the estimated heritability of this disorder. <strong>Herein, we propose a novel family-based study design and state-of-the-art genome sequencing techniques to map a set of sequence variants for asthma and its associated phenotypes and assess the interrelationships of the identified genes and variants using systems genomics methods.</strong> We have assembled a team of investigators highly-skilled and expert in whole genome sequencing (Drs. Michael Cho and Benjamin Raby), genetic association analysis (Drs. Scott T. Weiss, Jessica Lasky-Su and Christoph Lange), integrative genomics (Drs. Raby, Kelan Tantisira, Augusto Litonjua and Dawn DeMeo), and systems genomics (Drs. Weiss, Amitabh Sharma, Lange and Raby) to address this important problem with both a novel study design and data set.</p>",

The study setting is Group Health, an integrated health care delivery system in Washington State.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br> The HVH originated in 1988 with the examination of risk factors for MI. Over the ensuing years, the study has been funded by a series of grants, which have added case subjects with stroke, VT, and AF, and used a common control group. Study aims have focused on the associations of medication use with cardiovascular events. Starting in 1997, the study aims expanded to include genetic associations with cardiovascular disease. Participants recruited in 2009 or later and who provided blood samples for genetic analysis were asked for consent to deposit genetic and phenotype data in dbGaP.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong><br> As part of the HVH study, case subjects were identified by searching for ICD-9 codes consistent with MI, stroke, VT, or AF, and medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. Control subjects were identified at random from the Group Health enrollment and were matched to MI cases. All subjects have an index date. For cases, the index date was assigned as the date that the cardiovascular event (MI, stroke, VT, or AF) came to clinical attention. For controls, the index date was a random date within the range of the case index dates. For both cases and controls, information was collected from the inpatient and outpatient medical record, by telephone interview with consenting survivors, and from the Group Health pharmacy and laboratory databases. Consenting participants provided a blood specimen.</p>\n<p><strong>Genetic Research</strong><br> Genetic factors underlying cardiovascular disease are studied using DNA isolated from the blood samples.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The causal mechanisms of common diseases and their therapies have been only marginally illuminated by genetic variants identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS) utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Platelet activation pathways reflecting hemostasis and thrombosis are the underlying substrate for many cardiovascular diseases and related acute events. To overcome GWAS limitations, genomic studies are needed that integrate molecular surrogates for platelet-related phenotypes assayed in cell-based models derived from individuals of known genotypes and phenotypes. In our GWAS study of native platelet aggregation phenotypes and aggregation in response to low dose aspirin in 2200 subjects (GeneSTAR, Genetic Study of Aspirin Responsiveness), important genome wide \"signals\" (p&#x3C;5x10-8) associated with native platelet aggregation and important \"signals\" associated with platelet responsiveness to aspirin were identified and replicated. Although we are currently performing functional genomics studies to elucidate our most promising findings in known genes (PEAR1, MET, PIKC3G), most \"signals\" occurred in intergenic regions or in introns. Mechanistic interpretation is limited by uncertainty as to which gene(s) are up- or down-regulated in the presence of most SNP modifications. In this 3 phase proposal, we will (1) create pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and then differentiate these stem cells into megakaryocytes (2) develop an efficient strategy to produce iPS and megakaryocytes using a novel pooling method, and (3) produce iPS and megakaryocytes from 250 subjects in GeneSTAR (European Americans and African Americans), selected based on specific hypotheses derived from GWAS signals in native and post aspirin platelet function; characterize genetic mRNA transcripts using a comprehensive Affymetrix array; measure protein expression for transcripts of interest using mass spectrometry; examine mRNA and protein expression patterns for each GWAS signal to determine the functional pathway(s) involved in native platelet phenotypes; and examine the functional genomics of variations in responsiveness to aspirin using our prior genotyped and phenotyped population. Precise information about the exact functional processes in megakaryocytes and platelets may lead to innovative and tailored approaches to risk assessment and novel therapeutic targets to prevent first and recurrent cardiovascular and related thrombotic events.</p>",

Sarcoidosis is characterized by a hyperimmune response resulting in granuloma formation in multiple organs. It affects African Americans (AAs) more frequently and more severely than whites. While previous linkage, admixture, candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWA) studies show statistically compelling effects, causal variants are still unknown and much of sarcoidosis heritability is yet to be explained. This \"missing\" heritability likely includes effects of both common (minor allele frequency (MAF)>5%) and rare variants (MAF&#x3C;5%), since, in AAs, the former are inadequately represented and the latter are completely unexplored by commercial genotyping arrays. These facts, coupled with the availability of next-generation sequencing compel us to perform an exhaustive search for genetic variants that form the basis of sarcoidosis. The data generated are certain to identify candidate causal variants, provide fundamental insight for functional studies and lead to important new hypotheses of inflammation resulting in new treatments in not only sarcoidosis but other inflammatory diseases as well.</p>",

The major objectives of this study are to identify low frequency or rare variants in and around known common variant signals for CVD, as well as to find novel low frequency or rare variants influencing susceptibility to CVD.</p>\n<p>WGS of the SAFHS cohort has been obtained through three efforts. Approximately 540 WGS were performed commercially at 50X by Complete Genomics, Inc (CGI) as part of the large T2D-GENES Project. The phenotype and genotype data for this group is available at dbGaP under accession number <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000462\">phs000462</a>. An additional ~900 WGS at 30X were obtained through Illumina as part of the R01HL113322 \"Whole Genome Sequencing to Identify Causal Genetic Variants Influencing CVD Risk\" project. Finally, ~1,150 WGS at 30X WGS were obtained through Illumina funded by a supplement as part of the NHLBI's TOPMed program.</p>\n<p>Extensive phenotype data are provided for sequenced individuals primarily obtained from the P01HL45522 \"Genetics of Atherosclerosis in Mexican Americans\" for adults and R01HD049051 for children in these same families. Phenotype information was collected between 1991 and 2016. For this dataset, the SAFHS appellation represents an amalgamation of the original SAFHS participants and an expansion that reexamined families previously recruited for the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (R01DK042273) and the San Antonio Family Gall Bladder Study (R01DK053889). Due to this substantial examination history, participants may have information from up to five visits. The clinical variables reported are coordinated with TOPMed and include major adverse cardiac events (MACE), T2D status and age at diagnosis, glycemic traits (fasting glucose and insulin), blood pressure, blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Additional phenotype data include the medication status at each visit, classified in four categories as any current use of diabetes, hypertension or lipid-lowering medications, and, for females, current use of female hormones. Anthropometric measurements include age, sex, height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference and derived ratios. PBMC derived gene expression assays for a subset of ~1,060 individuals obtained using the Illumina Sentrix-6 chip is also available from the baseline examination.

MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84.

Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.</p>\n<p>In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by five examination periods that were 17-20 months in length.

This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping.</p>\n<p>The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.</p>",

Atrial fibrillation is a major clinical and public health problem that is related to atrial pathologic remodeling. Few tools are available to quantify the activity or extent of this remodeling, rendering it difficult to identify individuals at risk for AF. Previous studies have suggested an important role for miRNA in cardiovascular disease through gene expression regulation, making this a promising avenue for studying AF mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The aim of the study is to determine the time-dependent changes to key circulating miRNAs in a model of planned atrial injury and remodeling via ablation. Such knowledge might provide additional insight into the biology and activity of the acute atrial injury response, and furthermore, inform new targets for development of preventative interventions or allow for better AF risk stratification. To assess pathways regulating atrial pathological remodeling, patient blood samples are collected prior to their ablation procedures and also at a regularly scheduled 1-month follow-up appointment. Plasma expression of miRNA is measured using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), providing novel insights into the regulatory processes underlying AF, as well as acute atrial injury in vivo. Additionally, data collected from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is used to supplement miRNA analyses and further explore new relations between genes and abnormal heart rhythm.</p>",

Participants in this study include children with SCD treated with hydroxyurea to pharmacologically increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduce disease severity. Therefore, the primary phenotype of interest in this study is the change in HbF levels in response to hydroxyurea treatment. Genetic factors have been shown to influence inter-individual variation in drug response, and identification of novel genes and variants associated with clinical outcomes in SCD will be achieved through collaboration between Baylor College of Medicine, Augusta University, Columbia University Medical Center, Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

The REDS-III Brazil SCD Cohort study focused on transfusion practices and predictors of health outcomes in patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and began in the Fall of 2013. The four primary aims of this study are: 1) Aim A - Establish a cohort of SCD patients with a comprehensive centralized electronic database of detailed clinical, laboratory and transfusion information, as well as establish a repository of blood samples to support biological studies relevant to SCD pathogenesis and transfusion complications; 2) Aim B - Characterize changes in markers of inflammation in response to transfusion by analyzing chemokine/cytokine panels in serial post transfusion specimens; 3) Aim C - Identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to the risk of red blood cell alloimmunization in SCD by performing a genome-wide association (GWA) study in transfused SCD patients; and, 4) Aim D - Characterize risk of HIV and HIV outcomes in the Brazilian SCD population and compare SCD outcomes among HIV sero-positive and sero-negative SCD patients. Patients are enrolled from six hospitals affiliated with the participating four REDS-III Brazil hemocenters.</p>",

Subjects were enrolled at clinical centers in the US, Canada, Europe, and New Zealand. Inclusion criteria included subjects ages 40-75, at least 10 pack-years of smoking, and spirometry in GOLD grades 2-4 (COPD cases) or normal spirometry with post-bronchodilator FEV1 >85% (predicted) and FEV1/FVC>0.7 (controls). Study visits were performed at enrollment, three months, and every six months thereafter with spirometry, questionnaires, and other clinical evaluations. The ECLIPSE CT scans have been analyzed with the VIDA software for emphysema and airway phenotypes. ECLIPSE has provided key insights into the clinical epidemiology of COPD, including COPD exacerbations (Hurst, et. al., 2010, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20843247\"> 20843247</a>) and lung function decline in COPD (Vestbo, et. al., 2011, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21991892\"> 21991892</a>).

Hemophilia affects approximately 1/5000 male births worldwide, and results in premature death and disability due to bleeding if coagulation factor replacement therapy is not used effectively. Hemophilia is clinically categorized by coagulation factor activity levels and ranges in severity from mild (6% to 30%) to moderate (1-5%) to severe (&#x3C;1%). Many female \"carriers\" of hemophilia also have decreased factor activity and morbidity from bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are almost always caused by identifiable mutations in the F8 and F9 genes, respectively, and these mutations are found throughout the structural genes. Although the hemophilias are monogenic disorders, there are wide variations in disease severity and therapeutic outcomes which are not readily explained by the disease causing mutations alone.</p>\n<p>The My Life Our Future (MLOF) project (<a href=\"http://www.mylifeourfuture.org\">www.mylifeourfuture.org</a>) is a national resource developed by a partnership of BloodworksNW (BWNW, formerly the Puget Sound Blood Center), the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network (ATHN), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) and Bioverativ, to provide free F8 and F9 gene variant analysis to patients with hemophilia A or B, and to establish a research repository of DNA sequence, DNA, RNA, buffy coat, serum and plasma. The sequence analysis and serum samples are linked to a phenotypic database hosted by ATHN, with samples submitted and clinical data entered at ~100 hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) nationwide. (See ATHN Research Report Brief in the resource center at <a href=\"http://www.athn.org\">www.athn.org</a>). MLOF has become the largest hemophilia genetic project worldwide.</p>\n<p>The roles of the MLOF partners are: BWNW, to serve as the central laboratory for the project and house the research repository; ATHN, to support and provide the administrative link with HTCs, to facilitate the collection of accurate phenotypic data, to conduct research review and approval for use of the repository and with BWNW to provide samples and data for research projects; NHF, to provide consumer education and facilitate consumer input into the project; and Bioverativ, to provide financial support and scientific input. The project is governed by a Steering Committee consisting of one representative from each organization.</p>\n<p>Subject samples chosen from the MLOF parent study for TOPMed and WGS were drawn from those who gave (or parents gave) informed consent for the Research Repository and included patients of all severities and type, but with an emphasis on those with severe hemophilia and others at increased risk of neutralizing antibody (inhibitor) formation and who had samples in the Research Repository (plasma, serum, RNA) for potential additional -omic studies. Also included were samples from subjects where a likely causative variant for hemophilia was not found in the F8 or F9 coding region, intron-exon boundaries or immediate upstream and downstream regions.

    "description": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is the primary cause of many hospital admissions, and is associated with significant secondary morbidity by increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The incidence of AF is on the rise, and it is projected that by the year 2050 more than 10 million patients will be affected by AF in the United States alone. Anti-arrhythmic medications have limited success in maintaining sinus rhythm, are associated with side effects, and appear ineffective at reducing mortality compared to a strategy of rate control and anticoagulation. Given the significant morbidity associated with this common arrhythmia, surgical and catheter ablation techniques have been developed to treat AF. However, despite the incorporation of various strategies for ablation, long-term recurrence rates of AF remain higher than 25 percent after ablation. Current techniques for catheter ablation of AF include pulmonary vein isolation and complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation. However, the contribution of each strategy to long-term procedural success and the relative importance of each strategy for different patients remain unknown. Recent advances in cardiac imaging have allowed detailed analysis of left atrial myocardial anatomy. Parallel advances in molecular genetics have identified several candidate genes involved in familial and non-familial AF. However, the pathophysiology of AF generation and maintenance, and the potential contribution of such genetic or anatomic substrates for patient selection, and for target identification during catheter ablation have not yet been examined. Advances in molecular genetics and imaging, coupled with techniques for endocardial and epicardial mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory present an opportunity to significantly improve our understanding of (1) The relation of paroxysmal versus persistent AF with (a) structural left atrial changes (left/right atrial scar, wall thinning, pulmonary vein anomalies, and coronary sinus dilation) and with (b) candidate genetic variants. (2) The relation of candidate genetic variants with (a) structural left atrial changes and with (b) electrophysiologic properties (atrial effective refractory period (AERP) inhomogeneity, voltage abnormalities, trigger burden and location, C FAE extent and location), (3) The relation of structural left atrial changes with (a) CFAE location as targets for catheter ablation and with (b) reversible conduction block/myocardial injury after pulmonary vein isolation, and (4) Individualized endocardial targets for AF ablation based on candidate genes and anatomic substrates. The proposed study will improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of AF, and may improve current techniques for treatment of this important arrhythmia.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by homozygosity for a single mutation of the beta hemoglobin gene. Despite the constancy of this genetic abnormality, the clinical course of patients with SCD is remarkably variable. SCD can affect the function and cause the failure of multiple organ systems through the pathophysiologic processes of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. These pathophysiological processes are complex and expected to impact multiple organ systems in a variety of ways. This study, therefore, was designed to identify genetic factors that predispose SCD patients to develop specific end-organ complications and to experience more or less severe clinical courses. We enrolled > 700 patients with Hb SS, Hb S-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and HbSC being followed primarily at three southeastern U.S. regional institutions (Duke University Medical Center, University of North Carolina Medical Center, and Emory University Medical Center). Medical information obtained included the presence or absence of specific targeted outcomes (overall disease severity as well as specific types of end organ damage). Clinical data include medical status (history, physical, examination, and laboratory results) and information regarding potentially confounding environmental factors. Limited plasma samples are available for correlative studies (e.g. of cytokine levels, coagulation activation). Targeted SNP for candidate gene analysis as well as GWAS has been performed on most samples. Whole genome sequencing has been conducted through the TOPMed Consortium. The subjects in this analysis were collected as part of a larger study, \"Outcome Modifying Genes in Sickle Cell Disease\" (OMG-SCD) aimed at identifying genetic modifiers for sickle cell disease. More information about the study can be found in Elmariah et al. (2014), PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478166\">24478166</a>. Clinical and genetic data have been used to identify genetic characteristics predisposing patients with SCD to a more or less severe overall clinical course as well as to individual organ-specific complications. It is anticipated that identification of such genetic factors will reveal new therapeutic targets individualized to specific complications of SCD, leading to improved outcomes and increased life expectancy for patients with SCD.</p>",

With this broad ancestral diversity, BioMe is uniquely positioned to examine the impact of demographic and evolutionary forces that have shaped common disease risk.</p>\n<p>Phenotypes available in BioMe - BioMe has a high-quality and validated set of fully implemented clinical phenotype data that has been culled by a multi-disciplinary team of experienced investigators, clinicians, information technologists, data-managers, and programmers who apply advanced medical informatics and data mining tools to extract and harmonize EHRs. BioMe, as a cohort, offers a great versatility for designing nested case-control sample-sets, particularly for studying longitudinal traits and co-morbidity in disease burden.</p>\n<p>Biomedical and clinical outcomes: The BioMe Biobank is linked to Mount Sinai's system-wide Epic EHR, which captures a full spectrum of biomedical phenotypes, including clinical outcomes, covariate and exposure data from past, present and future health care encounters. As such, the BioMe Biobank has a longitudinal design as participants consent to make all of their EHR data from past (dating back as far as 2003), present and future inpatient or outpatient encounters available for research, without restriction. The median number of outpatient encounters is 21 per participant, reflecting predominant enrollment of participants with common chronic conditions from primary care facilities.</p>\n<p>Environmental data: The clinical and EHR information is complemented by detailed demographic and lifestyle information, including ancestry, residence history, country of origin, personal and familial medical history, education, socio-economic status, physical activity, smoking, dietary habits, alcohol intake, and body weight history, which is collected in a systematic manner by interview-based questionnaire at time of enrollment.</p>\n<p>The IPM BioMe Biobank contributed ~10,600 DNA samples for whole genome sequencing to the TOPMed program. Samples were selected for the Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) working groups. Using a Case-Definition-Algorithm (CDA), we identified ~4,100 individuals with CAD (~50% women) and ~3,000 individuals as controls (65% women). In addition, we identified ~800 individuals with COPD (62% women) and 1800 individuals as controls (72% women). Another 600 BioMe participants with Atrial Fibrillation, all of African ancestry, were included.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome, with affected individuals demonstrating marked differences in lung structure (emphysema vs. airway disease); physiology (airflow obstruction); and other clinical features (e.g., exacerbations, co-morbid illnesses). Multiple genomic regions influencing COPD susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and rare coding variants can also influence risk for COPD. However, only a small percentage of the estimated heritability for COPD risk can be explained by known genetic loci. Like most complex diseases, COPD is influenced by multiple genetic determinants (each with modest individual effects). Emerging evidence supports the paradigm that complex disease genetic determinants are part of a network of interacting genes and proteins; perturbations of this network can increase disease risk. To identify this network, multiple Omics data will need to be analyzed with methods to account for nonlinear relationships and interactions between key genes and proteins. Our overall hypothesis is that integrated network analysis of genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic data from biospecimens ranging from lung tissue to nasal epithelial cells to blood in highly phenotyped subjects will provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and heterogeneity. We will leverage the well-phenotyped, NHLBI-funded Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) to address these questions. We will perform multi-omics analysis in 1548 lung tissue and blood samples from the LTRC. With these multi-omics data, we will utilize a systems biology approach to understand relationships between multiple genetic determinants and multiple types of Omics data. We will begin by performing single Omics analyses in COPD vs. control lung, nasal, and blood samples. Next, we will integrate single Omics data with genetic variants identified by WGS to assist in fine mapping genetic determinants of COPD. We will then perform integrated network analysis of COPD with genetic and multiple Omics data using correlation-based, gene regulatory, and Bayesian networks. Subjects were recruited from Mayo Clinic, Universities of Colorado, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, and Temple University.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Myocardial ischemia occurs when there is a mismatch between coronary oxygen delivery and metabolic requirements of the myocardium, which may be clinically manifested during angina, coronary angioplasty or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Myocardial ischemia may lead to a spectrum of myocardial stunning, hibernating myocardium, and ultimately cell death if the ischemic insult is severe. In the human heart, irreversible damage begins after approximately 20 to 40 minutes of oxygen deprivation. Observed molecular and cellular changes of myocardial ischemia are characteristic of an inflammatory response, but the exact mechanisms that underlie this pathological process are unclear and may not be full emulated by animal models of ischemia or infarction. Thus, we felt it valuable to investigate a human ischemia model. During cardiac surgery, CPB with aortic cross-clamping (AoXC) and cardioplegic arrest is associated with excellent clinical outcomes and suitable operative conditions. However, despite the use of cardioprotective strategies, AoXc during CPB is accompanied by a variable, yet obligate ischemic period lasting 1 to 3 hours, resulting in hypoxia, metabolic substrate depletion, reperfusion injury, apoptosis, and necrosis. Cardiac specific biomarkers of ischemia and infarction, including troponin, are elevated even after routine coronary artery bypass graft surgery and correlate with the duration of ischemia from AoXc.</p>\n<p>This process of CPB provides us with the ability to examine the transcriptional profile before and after an expected, consistent, and reproducible human ischemic event, albeit induced by cold cardioplegic arrest and not coronary occlusion. In addition, the absence of reperfusion in this time period allows us to examine the transcriptomic response to intermittent ischemia, without having to account for the perturbations of reperfusion injury. Although various animal models have been used to examine the effects of ischemia on cardiac function, no human data exist which examine the early transcriptomic response to a left ventricular (LV) ischemic insult. We therefore characterized the effect of cold cardioplegia induced acute ischemia on the transcriptional profile of the LV by performing whole transcriptome next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery by sampling human LV tissue prior to, and after, the obligate ischemia during AoXC. We hypothesized that the cold cardioplegia induced ischemic injury will dramatically alter transcription in the human myocardium, and that we would identify genes and pathways, which will identify interventional targets for pharmacological therapy.</p>\n<p>Methods:</p>\n<p>We have collected left ventricle tissue samples and blood sample from patients undergoing heart surgery. We obtained punch biopsies (~3-5μg total RNA content) from the site of a routinely placed surgical vent in the anterolateral apical left ventricular wall of patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. After an average of 79 minutes of aortic cross-clamping with intermittent cold blood cardioplegia for myocardial protection every 20 minutes, a second biopsy was obtained in the same manner. Tissue samples were immediately placed in RNAlater® (Ambion, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and after 48 hours at +4°C were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were prepared by poly(A) mRNA isolation and reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 or HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). As samples were analyzed at different times, different read lengths were employed, initially using single-end reads (n=20) and then transitioning to paired end reads (n=216), ranging from 36 - 100 base pairs. Raw sequencing files were processed using Sickle, Skewer, and STAR software, and aligned to GrCh37 or UCSC Hg19.</p>\n<p>DNA was isolated from whole blood using standard methods. SNP genotyping was performed using the Illumina Omni2.5Exome-8 BeadChip array with additional exome content (Illumina, San Diego, CA) chip, version 1.1. We first phased and imputed 93 subjects using a phasing tool called SHAPEIT and an imputation tool called MINIMAC, with 1000 Genomes phase 1 version 3 for the reference panel. We then phased and imputed 26 more subjects using SHAPEIT, an imputation tool called IMPUTE2, and 1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Pediatric Cardiovascular Genetics Consortium (PCGC) proposes to define genetic causes for congenital heart defects (CHD) as part of the TOPMed Program are the most common form of heart disease in childhood and are also the most prevalent form of birth defects, occurring in 2-3% of live births. The PCGC has recruited and clinically characterized = 10,000 CHD probands and parents (CHD trios). From whole exome sequencing (WES) of >2800 CHD trios, we identified a substantial enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in genes important for cardiogenesis, particularly implicating histone modifier enzyme gene defects. Analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 350 probands with CHD unexplained by WES and their parents preliminarily implicated <em>de novo</em> mutations in enhancers of genes previously shown to cause CHD in mouse knock out models. Sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) from discarded cardiac tissues from CHD probands has revealed likely causal allele-specific expression (ASE) as well as biallelic loss of expression (LOE). We have also discovered de novo epimutations, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), some with underlying <em>de novo</em> DNA variation, that are detectable in peripheral blood leukocytes and appear to underlie 10% of CHD. Of note, these assorted 'omic' approaches have enabled one another, both for attributing causality and assessing functional impact. Based on these extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that PCGC probands with uninformative exomic analyses (WES-negative) harbor <em>de novo</em> genetic and/or epigenetic mutations in critical regulatory elements that participate in developmental expression of cardiac genes. To identify these etiologies, we propose analyses of WGS in 1000 WES-negative CHD trios, prioritizing those with probands with banked CHD tissues (n=78), one damaging variant in a recessive CHD gene, and older fathers (age>45). We also request WGS for 230 probands, for whom we have cardiac tissues but not parental DNAs. We request RNAseq for 308 cardiac tissues. For DNA methylation, which TOPMed will offer through the Illumina 850k array platform, we are requesting analysis of DNAs from peripheral blood leukocytes for all probands for whom WGS will be performed (1000 from trios, 230 singletons) as well as DNAs from cardiac tissues (n=308) to pair with the WGS, RNAseq and blood DNA methylation data. We will use existing resources and capabilities of the PCGC to confirm relevant mutations and those of its companion consortium in the Bench to Bassinet Program, the Cardiovascular Development Consortium, to inform analyses of non-coding mutations as well as to perform confirmatory functional genomics studies using cell and animal models. We expect that the studies resulting from data generated through TOPMed will provide novel insights into the molecular basis for CHD and fundamental knowledge about genes and pathways involved in cardiac development. Aside from being relevant to CHD, we anticipate that our findings will inform the understanding of later-onset cardiovascular diseases, including some arising in adulthood.</p>",

While Mendelian cardiovascular disorders are individually rare, collectively they impose a significant public health burden. This proposal focuses on 2 specific categories of cardiovascular disease for which we have extensive research expertise and existing cohorts, congenital heart disease (CHD) and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The tremendous burden on the health care system and on families with these Mendelian cardiovascular disorders underscore the urgency to understand their genomic bases, in order to design improved strategies for risk stratification, surveillance and medical intervention. Emerging evidence supports the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) over whole-exome sequencing (WES) for detecting coding variants in discovery projects, in addition to the obvious advantages of detecting features invisible to WES: structural variants (SV) and non-coding variants. We believe the way forward lies in widening the scope for discovery to include the patient's entire genome - and all types of variants. While family-based studies are crucial for genomic discovery, obtaining a sufficient number of high-risk pedigrees to achieve meaningful conclusions remains a challenge for most research institutions. For this proposal, we will leverage 2 powerful resources for the identification, ascertainment and recruitment of high-risk cardiovascular disease pedigrees: (1) the NHLBI-sponsored Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) and (2) the Utah Population Database (UPDB). We propose to perform WGS on PCGC and UPDB cohorts with autosomal dominant disease to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the genomic basis for CHD in high-risk pedigrees derived from the PCGC and UPDB; and Aim 2) Identify the genomic basis for inherited arrhythmia disorders, using extended pedigrees derived from the UPDB. Aim 2 focuses on familial forms of AF, undiagnosed Long QT Syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome and progressive conduction disorders.</p>\n<p>A WGS approach in high-risk pedigrees coupled with our validated bioinformatics pipeline, will allow the identification and prioritization of disease-causing SVs and sequence variants in coding and non-coding regulatory elements. These variants will be functionally characterized and validated in downstream experiments (heterologous expression systems, zebrafish cardiac assays, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) that are beyond the scope of this X01. For this proposal, we have assembled the right combination of clinical expertise, resources for patient recruitment and computational know-how to enable these game-changing methodologies and to apply them to the challenge of cardiovascular Mendelian disease-gene discovery.</p>",

It is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Molecular fingerprinting and extensive subject phenotyping will be performed to identify disease subpopulations and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity, which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for future clinical trials. Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data in studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.</p>\n<p><strong>Participating Institutions:</strong></p>\n<p>Research participants for SPIROMICS will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at twelve SPIROMICS Clinical Centers: Columbia University, Temple University, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Utah, National Jewish Health, University of California at San Francisco, and University of California at Los Angeles. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill serves as the Genomics and Informatics Center. The Radiology Reading Center is based at the University of Iowa. The PFT Reading Center is based at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Design:</strong></p>\n<p>SPIROMICS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 2,981 participants at twelve clinical centers over five years. Participants are distributed across four enrollment strata (i.e., Never-smokers, Smokers without COPD, Mild/Moderate COPD, and Severe COPD).</p>\n<p><strong>Study Visits:</strong></p>\n<p>Participants have up to four in-person visits (Baseline and Annual Clinic Visits at years 1, 2, 3 after Baseline). Study questionnaires and spirometry are completed at all main study visits. Blood and urine samples are collected at visits 1, 2, and 4. Sputum samples are collected at Visit 1. The CT scans are completed and Baseline and Visit 2. Participants also receive quarterly follow-up calls to assess health status and determine if an exacerbation has occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Substudies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bronchoscopy and Immunophenotyping Substudy The Bronchoscopy Substudy will enroll 50 subjects per site, for a total of 300 participants. These participants will be recruited across all four study strata. This substudy includes two study visits. During the first visit, sputum samples are collected for Immunophenotyping analysis at the Immunophenotyping Core Lab based at the University of Michigan. Participants then return for a second visit during which samples are collected via bronchoscopy, including bronchoalveolar lavage, epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies. Immunophenotyping analysis is also conducted on BAL and blood collected during the bronchoscopy study visit. - Repeatability Substudy The entire baseline clinic visit was repeated on 98 volunteers to determine reliability of measurement procedures. All baseline study-related procedures and questionnaires, including the CT scan, were re-administered and new samples of blood, urine, saliva, and sputum were collected. Field center staff processed these biospecimen samples according to the same protocol. - Exacerbation Substudy The Exacerbation Substudy is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of up to 400 participants, which will allow the assessment of participant-driven health care utilization (HCU) events and symptom-defined exacerbation events over time. HCU-driven events are defined by change in medical treatment in response to a perceived COPD Exacerbation. Symptom-based events will be defined by using EXACT-PRO (EXacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool - Patient Reported Outcome), a daily symptom diary developed to measure the frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations in clinical trials. All participants are provided with a PDA on which to complete the diary. Participants reporting a possible COPD exacerbation will be brought into the study clinic for a study visit to collect biological specimens and questionnaire data.\n<u>The overall objectives of the Exacerbation Substudy are to</u>:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain clinical data and specimens on SPIROMICS participants before and during an acute COPD exacerbation defined by <ol type=\"a\"> <li>Health care utilization triggered by the subject, or 1.

    "description": "<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive condition characterized by narrowing or stiffening pulmonary arterioles resulting in increased pulmonary blood pressure and reduced delivery of oxygenated blood to the body. It is a common complication of sickle cell disease and initially presents with the symptom of shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion. As the condition worsens, other symptoms such as dizziness, lower extremity edema, and chest pain can develop. The drug, sildenafil, works by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs which reduces pulmonary blood pressure and allows more oxygenated blood to circulate. Increased levels of oxygenated blood allows individuals with PAH to tolerate more activity, but guidelines for using sildenafil in patients with PAH and sickle cell disease were unavailable at the time of the Walk-PHaSST trial.</p>\n<p>Participants were screened for the existence of pulmonary hypertension with a six minute walk test and a Doppler echocardiogram that assessed TRV, diastolic function, and valvular and systolic function. Subjects with TRV ≥ 2.7 m/s received further clinical evaluation for possible causes of pulmonary hypertension. Other screening data included medical history, a physical exam, and standard laboratory testing. For individuals with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (TRV ≥ 3.0), a cardiac catheterization was done at the baseline and week 16 data collection periods.</p>\n<p>Subjects eligible for the main intervention trial based on screening results were randomized in a 1:1 double blind fashion to receive sildenafil or placebo for 16 weeks. Subjects received 20 mg of oral sildenafil or matching placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks, followed by 80 mg 3 times daily for 6 weeks, as tolerated. Participants could also receive other therapies as needed to manage sickle cell and related complications. The primary outcome measure of the trial was change in the six minute walk test, a standard indicator of a person's heart and lung function and exercise capacity, from baseline to week 16. After completing the study treatment (or placebo), participants could choose to be part of the open-label follow-up phase of the study and continue to be assessed for up to one year.</p>\n<p>The study was intended to screen about 1000 subjects and randomize 132 subjects, however it was terminated early due to the unforeseen increase in adverse events in participants treated with sildenafil as compared to placebo. When the study was stopped, 33 participants had completed the trial. Subjects continued to be monitored, but were instructed to taper sildenafil treatment over three to seven days.</p>\n<p>There was no evidence that treatment with sildenafil impacted the six minute walk distance from baseline to week 16. In addition, treatment with sildenafil appeared to increase rates of hospitalization due to sickle cell disease pain.</p>\n<p>Due to in part to the early termination of the trial, the majority of subject data was collected from the screening phase of the study (n=720), as opposed to the main intervention trial (n=74).</p>\n<p>Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at <a href=\"https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/\">https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/</a>.

    "description": "<p>The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) is a hematopoietic cell transplant registry that was established in 1972 at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The overarching goal of the registry is to study trends in transplantations and to advance the understanding and application of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for malignant and non-malignant diseases. Included in this dataset are children, adolescents and young adults with severe sickle cell disease who received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in the United States and provided written informed consent for research.</p>\n<p>Hematopoietic cell transplant for sickle cell disease is curative. Offering this treatment for patients with severe disease is challenging as only about 20-25% of patients expected to benefit have an HLA-matched sibling. Consequently, several transplantations have utilized an HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated adult donor and HLA-mismatched relative. Transplantation strategies have also evolved over time that has included transplant conditioning regimens of varying intensity, grafts other than bone marrow and novel approaches to overcome the donor-recipient histocompatibility barrier and limit graft-versus-host disease. The data that is available for sickle cell disease transplants have been utilized to report on outcomes after transplantation and compare outcomes after transplantation of grafts HLA-matched related, HLA-mismatched related, HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors. Collectively, these data have advanced our knowledge and understanding of hematopoietic cell transplant for this disease. These data can also serve as \"contemporaneous controls\" for comparison with other more recent curative treatments like gene therapy and gene editing.</p>\n<p>Data available for request include allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants for sickle cell disease (Hb SS and Hb Sβ thalassemia) in the United States from 1991 to 2019.

To prevent first strokes, the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) used prophylactic transfusions in children who were identified by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography as being at high risk for stroke. This strategy reduced the incidence of stroke among such children from 10% per year to less than 1% per year, leading to recommendations for TCD screening and prophylactic transfusion for children with abnormal velocities on ultrasonography.</p>\n<p>Despite the reduced risk of stroke, long-term use of transfusions can cause adverse side effects, such as iron overload or alloimmunization. However, cessation of transfusions is associated with recurrence of stroke, and at the time of the STOP II trial, there were no clinical or laboratory indicators to guide the duration of prophylaxis. Therefore the STOP II trial was initiated to determine whether transfusions could be limited by monitoring patients with TCD examinations after transfusions were halted and resuming transfusions if the examination indicated a high risk of stroke.</p>\n<p>The trial was halted for safety concerns after 79 of a planned 100 children were randomized. Discontinuation of transfusion for the prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell disease resulted in a high rate of reversion to abnormal blood-flow velocities on Doppler studies and stroke incidence.</p>\n<p>Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at <a href=\"https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/\">https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/</a>.

The study began in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. National Institutes of Health (NIH) renewals provided expansion of the original cohort, including increased minority recruitment, and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. The <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/datasets/cfs\">CFS</a> was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first-degree relatives, spouses and available second-degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first-degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4-year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. Currently, data of 710 individuals are available for use through <a href=\"https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/\">BioData Catalyst</a> (with genotype data available through <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/\">dbGaP</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/\">National Sleep Research Resource</a> (NSRR) is a NIH-supported sleep data repository that offers free access to large collections of de-identified physiological signals and related clinical data from a large range of cohort studies, clinical trials and other data sources from children and adults, including healthy individuals from the community and individuals with known sleep or other health disorders.  The goals of <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/\">NSRR</a> are to facilitate rigorous research that requires access to large or more diverse data sets, including raw physiological signals, to promote a better understanding of risk factors for sleep and circadian disorders and/or the impact of sleep disturbances on health-related outcomes.

Heavily transfused patients frequently develop human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allo-immunization resulting in platelet transfusion refractoriness and a high risk for life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Data suggest complement activation leading to the destruction of platelets bound by HLA allo-antibodies may play a pathophysiologic role in platelet refractoriness. We conducted a pilot trial to investigate the use of eculizumab to treat platelet transfusion refractoriness in allo-immunized patients with severe thrombocytopenia. We hypothesized that when we treated patients having platelet refractoriness with eculizumab, platelet counts would increase to higher numbers after platelet transfusions, decreasing the risk of bleeding complications associated with having a low platelet count. The response of the treatment was assessed by the corrected platelet count increment (CCI) 10 - 60 min and 18 - 24 h post transfusion, and any requirement for subsequent platelet transfusions following eculizumab. Reference 1 (PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32086819/\">32086819</a>) contains the main results for this trial.</p>",

Disability was assessed by self-report of limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Financial problems were assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 question and questions regarding job changes, time off work, and insurance coverage developed with the Mi-COVID-19 study using qualitative interviews. Quality of life was measured using the European Quality of Life 5-dimension 5-level instrument.</p>\n<p>The primary outcomes were new or worsened cardiopulmonary symptoms, financial problems, functional impairments, perceived return to baseline health, and quality of life.

Children with sickle cell disease experience organ damage, impaired quality of life, and premature mortality. A blood stem cell transplant is a treatment option for someone with a severe form of the disease. Prior to undergoing a transplant, people typically receive a conditioning regimen of high doses of chemotherapy and other medications to prepare the body to accept the transplant. This type of conditioning regimen is known as a myeloablative conditioning regimen, but it can result in toxicities and sterility. A conditioning regimen that uses lower doses of chemotherapy and medications may be safer for transplant recipients. This type of regimen is known as reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. RIC has a more favorable toxicity profile but is associated with higher rates of graft rejection (GR), especially with graft sources such as umbilical cord blood This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of blood stem cell transplants, using bone marrow from unrelated donors, in children with severe SCD who receive a RIC regimen prior to the transplant.</p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>Patients 3.0-19.75 years old with symptomatic SCD AND one or more of the following complications: (1)-(i) a clinically significant neurologic event (stroke) or any neurologic defect lasting > 24 hours and accompanied by an infarct on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); OR, (ii) patients who have a Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity that exceeds 200 cm/sec by the non-imaging technique (or TCD measurement of >185 cm/sec by the imaging technique) measured at a minimum of 2 separate occasions one month or more apart; OR, (2) Minimum of two episodes of acute chest syndrome within the preceding 2-year period defined as new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involving at least one complete lung segment (associated with acute symptoms including fever, chest pain, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, or cough that is not attributed to asthma or bronchiolitis) despite adequate supportive care measures; OR, (3) History of 3 or more severe pain events (defined as new onset of pain that lasts for at least 2 hours for which there is no other explanation) per year in the 2 years prior to enrollment despite adequate supportive care measures (if patients are receiving hydroxyurea and compliant with therapy, being symptomatic is an indication for transplantation; however, if patients decline hydroxyurea or non-compliant with this therapy, they would still remain eligible for study if pain criteria as described above are met). Lansky/Karnofsky performance score must be ≥ 40. Hemoglobin S must be ≤ 45%. Patients must have an unrelated adult bone marrow donor who is HLA-matched at 8 of 8 HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at high resolution using DNA-based typing. Patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver, with uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in the past month, or seropositivity for HIV are excluded. Patients with HLA-matched family donors, or who have received prior HCT, and females who are pregnant or breast feeding are excluded. Thirty patients were enrolled on this study and of these, 29 patients met the criteria and proceeded to the study transplant.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>Participants attended a study visit prior to the transplant to undergo a blood collection, neurocognitive testing to measure learning and brain function, magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Questionnaires to assess quality of life were also completed. All patients received erythrocyte transfusions before transplant. Twenty-two days (-22) before the transplant, participants began receiving a reduced intensity conditioning regimen of chemotherapy and medications. On days -21, -20, and -19 participants weighing 10 kg or more received 10 mg, 15 mg, and then 20 mg of Alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) followed by 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day IV on days -8 through -4 of Fludarabine. Eight days (-8) before the transplant, participants were admitted to the hospital to continue the conditioning regimen which included 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV of Melphalan on day -3. Participants received the bone marrow transplant on day 0. Prophylaxis for GVHD consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) administered from day -3 through day 100 after graft infusion, with subsequent taper through day 180; methotrexate 7.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 3, and 6; and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg per day from days 7 through 28, with subsequent taper by 20% per week. One week after the transplant continuing until the WBC is normal, participants received granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After leaving the hospital, participants attended study visits weekly during weeks 1 to 8, at day 60, weekly during weeks 9 to 14, at Day 100, at month 6, and at years 1 and 2. At all study visits, a blood collection, medical history review, and physical exam occurred. In addition, at day 100, month 6, and years 1 and 2, questionnaires to assess quality of life were completed. At select visits the following procedures were conducted: lung function testing, heart function testing, MRA and MRI scans, and neurocognitive testing.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was 1-year EFS. Death, disease recurrence or graft rejection by 1 year were considered events for this endpoint.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>The trial met its prespecified 1-year EFS, and significantly improved HRQL was reported posttransplant. However, although the Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) provided successful engraftment in most patients, the regimen cannot be considered safe for widespread adoption without modification due to the regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and high rate of chronic GVHD, which was the predominant cause of mortality.<br></p>",

Further, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension in adults over 50 years of age. Observational studies have shown a monotonic increase in cardiovascular risk with systolic blood pressures above 115 mm Hg; however, general population clinical trials have only documented the benefits of lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 150 mm Hg. A 2007 expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designated the hypothesis that lowering the systolic blood pressure goal to a level &#x3C;120 mm Hg as the most important hypothesis to test in reducing hypertension related complications in those without diabetes.</p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>A total of 9361 participants were enrolled, with 4,678 randomized to the intensive-treatment group and 4,683 randomized to the standard-treatment group.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>SPRINT was a randomized, single blinded (outcome adjudicators were blinded to treatment assignment) treatment trial with participants randomized to a systolic blood-pressure target of either less than 140 mm Hg (the standard-treatment group) or less than 120 mm Hg (the intensive-treatment group). Following randomization, baseline hypertensive regimens were adjusted in accordance with study treatment algorithms established for each group. The study formulary included all major classes of antihypertensive agents. Investigators could prescribe other antihypertensive medications, but the use of drug classes with the strongest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes was encouraged. This included thiazide-type diuretics as the first-line agent, loop diuretics for participants with advanced chronic kidney disease, and beta-adrenergic blockers for participants with coronary artery disease. Medications for participants in the intensive-treatment group were adjusted on a monthly basis to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. Medications for participants in the standard-treatment group were adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 139 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced if systolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg on a single visit or less than 135 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Lifestyle modification was encouraged as part of the management strategy.</p>\n<p>Participants were seen monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. A structured interview was used in both groups every 3 months to obtain self-reported cardiovascular disease outcomes. Medical records and electrocardiograms were obtained for documentation of events. Incidences of hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and bradycardia that were evaluated in an emergency department were included in adverse event reporting. Occurrences of acute kidney injury or acute renal failure requiring hospitalization were also monitored. <br>The primary outcome was a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>The blood pressure intervention was stopped in August of 2015 (median follow-up of 3.26 years) after the cardiovascular outcome results exceeded the boundary for efficacy at two consecutive time points. Compared with a systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm Hg, an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause. Significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.</p>",

Evidence from previous clinical trials supports the use of coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) to relieve disabling symptoms of angina, particularly among high-risk subgroups with extensive CAD. However, the studies did not include patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, and developments in medical therapy have since led to updated guidelines. In addition, the benefits of CABG in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy had still not been clearly established at the time of this study. STICH sought to evaluate the role of CABG in the treatment of patients with CAD and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.<br></p>\n<p>Reduced left ventricular function may occur after myocardial infarction, often in conjunction with left ventricular remodeling, including left ventricular enlargement and changes in chamber geometry. Left ventricular remodeling is correlated with progression of heart failure and a poor prognosis. Therefore, a surgical approach to remodeling through left ventricular volume reduction could improve outcomes for patients with CAD and heart failure. Surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) has been shown to reduce the left ventricular volume, increase the ejection fraction, and improve ventricular function. There is also evidence that SVR performed with CABG may reduce the rate of hospitalization and improve ventricular function, as compared to CABG alone. As part of a second hypothesis, STICH additionally investigated whether SVR when added to CABG would improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and CAD.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 2,136 participants were enrolled in STICH. 1,212 were enrolled in the hypothesis 1 component of the trial, with 602 participants assigned to receive medical therapy alone, and 610 participants assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG. 1,000 were enrolled in the hypothesis 2 component, with 499 participants assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG, and 501 participants assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG and SVR. 76 participants that were assigned to the CABG with medical therapy treatment were enrolled in both hypothesis components.<br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>After initial determination of overall eligibility, participants were evaluated to determine which component of the STICH program was appropriate for them on the basis of suitable therapeutic options. All participants underwent cardiac imaging for assessment of left ventricular function and wall motion. Participants in the hypothesis 1 component were randomly assigned to receive either medical therapy alone or medical therapy plus CABG. Participants in the hypothesis 2 component were randomly assigned to receive either medical therapy plus CABG or medical therapy plus CABG and SVR.<br></p>\n<p>At baseline, demographic factors and clinical characteristics were assessed, including current medications and prior diagnostic and other cardiovascular procedures, and a physical examination was performed. Guideline-based recommendations for drug and device use were emphasized for all participants. All participants underwent follow-up evaluations at the time of discharge or at 30 days for participants still hospitalized, every 4 months for the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. The median length of follow-up was 56 months for hypothesis 1 and 48 months for hypothesis 2.<br></p>\n<p>For participants receiving CABG, arterial grafting for stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery was required for all participants without specific contraindications. The use of additional arterial conduits supplemented by vein grafts was recommended for revascularization of all major vessels with clinically significant stenoses. Concurrent mitral-valve surgery for regurgitation was performed at the discretion of the surgeon. For participants receiving SVR, the operation was most commonly performed during a single period of cardioplegic arrest after construction of bypass grafts. However, the procedure could also be performed with the heart beating in order to facilitate identification of the noncontractile zone of scarring. After an anterior left ventriculotomy was centered in the zone of anterior asynergy, a suture was placed in the interior of the ventricle to encircle the scar at the boundary between the akinetic and viable tissue. Visual inspection and palpation facilitated the judgment of whether a patch was needed to optimize the chamber size without deforming the left ventricle during closure of the ventriculotomy.<br></p>\n<p>The primary outcome for hypothesis 1 was the rate of death from any cause. The primary outcome for hypothesis two was a composite of death from any cause and hospitalization for cardiac causes.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>There was no significant difference between medical therapy alone and medical therapy plus CABG for death from any cause, though participants that underwent CABG had lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes, death from any cause, or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. Adding SVR to CABG reduced the left ventricular volume, as compared with CABG alone. However, this anatomical change was not associated with a greater improvement in symptoms or exercise tolerance, or with a reduction in the rate of death or hospitalization for cardiac causes.</p>",

    "description": "<p><u>Objective</u><br>To assess whether high-dose spironolactone treatment for patients with acute heart failure lowers natriuretic peptide levels and improves outcomes better than usual care.<br></p>\n<p><u>Background</u><br>Acute heart failure (AHF) accounts for more than a million hospitalizations in the United States annually. The role of low-dose mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists (MRAs) therapy as a neurohormonal antagonist is well established for the treatment of chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. However, the role of high-dose MRA therapy in AHF remained uncertain. A previous clinical trial suggested that the benefits of high-dose MRA therapy in AHF included lower natriuretic peptide levels, less congestion, better renal function, and less need for an intravenous diuretic. <br></p>\n<p>The use of intravenous loop diuretics can intensify secondary hyperaldosteronism among AHF patients, and hyperaldosteronism directly contributes to diuretic resistance in AHF. Elevated aldosterone levels in AHF are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and HF readmission. Hospitalizations for heart failure are associated with increased risk of mortality and/or readmission.<br></p>\n<p>The HFN-ATHENA trial was conducted to determine if mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses relieved congestion, decreased diuretic resistance, and mitigated the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF.<br></p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>The ATHENA trial enrolled 360 participants. Of these, 178 participants were randomized to usual care treatment (placebo or low-dose spironolactone) and 182 participants were randomized to high-dose spironolactone.<br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>The study intervention was initiated within 24 hours of patients receiving the first dose of intravenous diuretics. Participants not taking spironolactone at enrollment were randomized to 100 mg spironolactone or a placebo. Participants taking low-dose spironolactone before their hospital admission were randomized to 100 mg or 25 mg per day in the usual care treatment arm. Prescription of all other medications, including diuretics, was left at the discretion of the treating physician. The study drug was discontinued after 96 hours and further MRA use was left to the treating physician's discretion. The primary end point was the proportional change in the log NT-proBNP levels from randomization to 96 hours (or at the hospital discharge if the discharge occurred earlier than 96 hours). Secondary endpoints included: (1) a clinical congestion score; (2) dyspnea relief; (3) daily cumulative net urine output for up to 96 hours; (4) net weight change from baseline to 96 hours or discharge (whichever came first); (5) furosemide equivalents of the loop diuretic dosage at discharge; and (6) the development of in-hospital worsening HF, with signs and symptoms requiring additional therapy.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>There was no significant difference in the primary or secondary endpoints between the high-dose treatment arm and the usual care treatment arm. <br></p>",

It occurs in 25 to 33% of patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Current heart failure treatments focus on removing excess fluid buildup, however administration of intravenous diuretics may contribute to worsening renal function. Venovenous ultrafiltration is one alternative therapy that may be effective in patients with acute decompensated heart failure complicated by acute cardiorenal syndrome and persistent congestion<br></p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>A total of 188 patients were randomized.<br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>Hospitalized subjects were randomly assigned to receive either ultrafiltration therapy or pharmacologic therapy. Ultrafiltration was performed at a fluid-removal rate of 200 ml per hour and loop diuretics were discontinued for the duration of the intervention. The addition of intravenous vasodilators or positive inotropic agents was prohibited, unless they were deemed to be necessary as rescue therapy. Patients assigned to stepped pharmacologic therapy received intravenous diuretics to manage congestion and maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 liters per day. In both groups, the assigned treatment strategy was to be continued until the signs and symptoms of congestion in the patient were reduced as much as possible. The primary end points were baseline changes in serum creatinine and weight as assessed at 96 hours after treatment assignment.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>The use of a stepped pharmacologic-therapy algorithm was superior to a strategy of ultrafiltration for the preservation of renal function, and there was a similar amount of weight loss between the two groups. Ultrafiltration was associated with a higher rate of adverse events (Bart, et al., 2012, PMID: <a href=\"http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131078/\">23131078</a>).<br></p>",

Intravenous loop diuretics are an essential component of current treatment and are administered to approximately 90% of patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite decades of clinical experience with these agents, prospective data to guide the use of loop diuretics are sparse, and current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion. As a result, clinical practice varies widely with regard to both the mode of administration and the dosing.<br></p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>A total of 308 patients were enrolled between March 2008 and November 2009 at 26 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. <br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>The DOSE study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design. Patients were randomly assigned to either a low-dose strategy (total intravenous furosemide dose equal to their total daily oral loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents) or a high-dose strategy (total daily intravenous furosemide dose 2.5 times their total daily oral loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents) and to administration of furosemide either by intravenous bolus every 12 hours or by continuous intravenous infusion.<br></p>\n<p>The study treatment, with group assignments concealed, was continued for up to 72 hours. At 48 hours, the treating physician had the option of adjusting the diuretic strategy on the basis of the clinical response. An assessment of biomarkers, including creatinine, cystatin C, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, was performed at a central core laboratory at baseline, 72 hours, and 60 days. Patients were followed for clinical events to day 60. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

The potential uses of the NHDR are broad, including providing matched controls for clinical trials, observing a cohort of untreated patients as part of a natural history study, or conducting comparative effectiveness research on a subpopulation with selected co-morbidities or drug treatment profiles. The SCD NHDR includes two multi-center SCD longitudinal cohort studies with extensive annual clinical data and patient surveys, the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC-I and SCDIC-II) and the Globin Research Network for Data and Discovery (GRNDaD). The SCDIC-I, initiated in 2017 and concluded in June 2022, enrolled over 2400 patients with SCD from 8 US treatment centers. The SCDIC-II reconsented 1220 of the SCDIC-I patients as well as enrolling an additional 450 new patients from the same 8 centers between September 2022 and October 2023, for a total of 1670 in SCDIC-II.

Heart failure is characterized by an imbalance between left ventricular (LV) performance and myocardial energy consumption. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests oxidative stress contributes to ventricular and vascular remodeling, and disease progression in heart failure. Targeting potential source(s) of oxidative stress, e.g. Xanthine oxidase (XO), was the focus of recent clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Increased XO activity has been shown to lead to production of superoxide and uric acid (UA). Serum uric acid levels are included in heart failure risk scores, and hyperuricemia is present in about 25% of patients with heart failure. Hyperuricemia is associated with exercise intolerance, reduced survival, and worsening symptoms. The EXACT-HF trial tested allopurinol, an inhibitor of XO, as a potential target therapy for hyperuricemic heart failure patients.</p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>253 subjects were enrolled in the EXACT-HF study. 128 participants were randomized to the allopurinol arm, and of those participants, 119 completed the trial and 9 did not. 125 participants were randomized to the placebo arm, and of those participants, 116 completed the trial and 9 did not.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>EXACT-HF was a multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, 24-week trial of allopurinol. Eligible participants had to be receiving a stable regimen for at least two weeks (3 months for beta-blockers) prior to randomization. Participants were randomized by an automated system to either the allopurinol or placebo arm, and started treatment within 12 hours of completing the baseline visit. During the first week, participants in both treatment arms received 300mg daily of the respective medications. For the following 23 weeks, participants in both treatment arms received 600mg daily of the respective medications. Patients unable to tolerate 600 mg were maintained on 300 mg.<br>The primary endpoint was a composite clinical endpoint (CCE) that classified a subject's clinical status as improved, worsened, or unchanged at 24 weeks. The CCE was determined based on the following: death; hospitalization, emergency room visit or emergent clinic visit for worsening HF; medication change for worsening HF; and Patient Global Assessment using a 7-point scale. Secondary endpoints at 12 and 24 weeks included changes in quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and submaximal exercise capacity as assessed by a 6-minute walk test.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>Participants who received allopurinol had significantly less serum uric acid laboratory levels after 24 weeks; however, no significant difference was observed in the primary and secondary endpoints between the allopurinol and placebo-treated patients. Therefore, in high-risk HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated uric acid levels, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol failed to improve clinical status, exercise capacity, quality of life, or LVEF at 24 weeks (Circulation. 2015 May 19; 131(20):1763-71).<br></p>",

Expected increases in event rates will be associated with a concomitant rise in suffering and resource utilization.</p>\n<p>The ACCORD study investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors when compared to standard therapy (HbA1c between 7.0% and 7.9%). A separate analysis investigated whether reduction of blood glucose concentration decreases the rate of microvascular complications in these patients.</p>\n<p><u>Lipid Therapy Trial: </u><br>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease attributable, in part, to associated risk factors such as dyslipidemia. This is characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. The ACCORD Lipid Therapy trial was designed to test the effect of a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to raise HDL-C and lower triglyceride levels and uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C reduce the rate of CVD events compared to a strategy that only uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes that were at high risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p><u>Blood Pressure Trial:</u> <br>Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease at every level of systolic blood pressure. Because cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes is graded and continuous across the entire range of levels of systolic blood pressure, even at prehypertensive levels, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) recommended beginning drug treatment in patients with diabetes who have systolic blood pressures of 130 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of reducing systolic blood pressure to below 130 mm Hg. There is, however, a paucity of evidence from randomized clinical trials to support these recommendations. The ACCORD Blood Pressure trial tested the effect of a target systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg on major cardiovascular events among high-risk persons with type 2 diabetes compared to a strategy that targeted a SBP of &#x3C; 140 mm Hg.</p>\n<p><u>EYE Substudy:</u> <br>Diabetic retinopathy, an important microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Randomized, controlled clinical trials in cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes have shown the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control and intensive treatment of elevated blood pressure on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been implicated, in observational studies and small trials, as additional risk factors for the development of diabetic retinopathy and visual loss. The ACCORD EYE Substudy evaluated the effects of the ACCORD medical strategies on the progression of diabetic retinopathy in a subgroup of trial patients.</p>\n<p><u>MIND Substudy:</u> <br>Studies suggest that older persons with type 2 diabetes have at least twice the likelihood of developing late-life cognitive impairment or dementia compared to those without.

At the time of the RELAX trial, clinical trials of renin-angiotensin system antagonists had not demonstrated improvement in outcomes or clinical status in HFpEF, and effective therapies were needed. Phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) metabolizes the nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptide (NP) systems' second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and thus may limit beneficial NO and NP actions in the heart, vasculature and kidney. Pre-clinical studies suggest that inhibition of PDE-5 reverses adverse cardiac structural and functional remodeling and enhances vascular, neuroendocrine and renal function. In clinical studies, PDE-5 inhibitor therapy improved exercise tolerance and clinical status in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). A small, single-center study in HFpEF observed improved hemodynamics, left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, right ventricular (RV) systolic function, LV hypertrophy and lung function with chronic PDE-5 inhibition as compared to placebo. In aggregate, these studies suggested the potential for PDE-5 inhibition to ameliorate several key pathophysiological perturbations in HFpEF, and thus improve exercise capacity and clinical status.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 216 participants were enrolled in the trial with 113 in the Sildenafil group and 103 in the placebo group.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Participants who met screening criteria underwent baseline studies including a history and physical examination, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPXT), six-minute walk distance, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ), echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and phlebotomy for biomarkers.

If the dose was well tolerated at 12 weeks, it was increased to 60 mg TID for another 12 weeks.

Further, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension in adults over 50 years of age. Observational studies have shown a monotonic increase in cardiovascular risk with systolic blood pressures above 115 mm Hg; however, general population clinical trials have only documented the benefits of lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 150 mm Hg. A 2007 expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designated the hypothesis that lowering the systolic blood pressure goal to a level &#x3C;120 mm Hg as the most important hypothesis to test in reducing hypertension related complications in those without diabetes.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Subjects</u></strong></p>\n<p>A total of 9361 participants were enrolled, with 4,678 randomized to the intensive-treatment group and 4,683 randomized to the standard-treatment group.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design</u></strong></p>\n<p>SPRINT was a randomized, single blinded (outcome adjudicators were blinded to treatment assignment) treatment trial with participants randomized to a systolic blood-pressure target of either less than 140 mm Hg (the standard-treatment group) or less than 120 mm Hg (the intensive-treatment group). Following randomization, baseline hypertensive regimens were adjusted in accordance with study treatment algorithms established for each group. The study formulary included all major classes of antihypertensive agents. Investigators could prescribe other antihypertensive medications, but the use of drug classes with the strongest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes was encouraged. This included thiazide-type diuretics as the first-line agent, loop diuretics for participants with advanced chronic kidney disease, and beta-adrenergic blockers for participants with coronary artery disease. Medications for participants in the intensive-treatment group were adjusted on a monthly basis to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. Medications for participants in the standard-treatment group were adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 139 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced if systolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg on a single visit or less than 135 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Lifestyle modification was encouraged as part of the management strategy.</p>\n<p>Participants were seen monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. A structured interview was used in both groups every 3 months to obtain self-reported cardiovascular disease outcomes. Medical records and electrocardiograms were obtained for documentation of events. Incidences of hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and bradycardia that were evaluated in an emergency department were included in adverse event reporting. Occurrences of acute kidney injury or acute renal failure requiring hospitalization were also monitored.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions</u></strong></p>\n<p>The blood pressure intervention was stopped in August of 2015 (median follow-up of 3.26 years) after the cardiovascular outcome results exceeded the boundary for efficacy at two consecutive time points. Compared with a systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm Hg, an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause. Significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.</p>",

Patients with acute heart failure and moderate or severe renal dysfunction are at risk for inadequate decongestion and worsening renal function - both of which are associated with worse outcomes. Renal adjuvant therapies that enhance decongestion and preserve renal function during treatment of acute heart failure are needed.</p>\n<p>Dopamine is an endogenous catecholamine which, at low doses, may selectively activate dopamine receptors and promote renal vasodilatation. Previous studies have suggested that the addition of low dose dopamine to diuretic therapy enhances decongestion and preserves renal function during diuretic therapy in acute heart failure; however, these studies were small with variable study designs and dopamine doses.</p>\n<p>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac peptide with vasodilating, renin and aldosterone inhibiting, natriuretic and diuretic properties. Nesiritide is human recombinant BNP approved for management of acute heart failure. The recommended dose lowers blood pressure and atrial pressures and produces modest improvement in dyspnea, but does not favorably impact clinical outcomes or renal function, potentially due to its hypotensive effects. Small studies using low dose nesiritide in acute heart failure and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated favorable effects on urine output and renal function.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation (ROSE) trial was initiated to determine the benefits and safety of intravenous administration of low dose nesiritide or low dose dopamine in patients with congestive heart failure and kidney dysfunction.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 360 participants were enrolled.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Participants were enrolled within 24 hours of hospital admission and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the nesiritide or dopamine strategies. Participants randomized to the dopamine strategy were randomized in a double-blind 2:1 ratio to low dose dopamine (2 µg/kg/min for 72 hours infused via local guideline stipulated vascular access) or placebo. Participants randomized to the nesiritide strategy were randomized in a double-blind 2:1 ratio to low dose nesiritide (0.005 μg/kg/min for 72 hours infused via peripheral intravenous access without initial bolus) or placebo.</p>\n<p>All participants received open-label, intravenous loop diuretic treatment with a recommended total daily dose equal to 2.5x the total daily oral outpatient furosemide (or equivalent) dose at 7 days prior to admission up to a maximum of 600 mg/day. Participants naive to outpatient loop diuretics received 80 mg/day of intravenous furosemide. One-half of the total daily diuretic dose was administered as a bolus twice daily for at least 24 hours. Use of other medications and diuretic dosing after 24 hours were at the discretion of the clinician. All participants were placed on a 2000 mg sodium diet and 2000 cc fluid restriction. After the primary endpoint assessment at 72 hours, study drug was discontinued and subsequent treatment was at the clinician's discretion. The two co-primary endpoints were the 72-hour cumulative urinary volume as an index of decongestion efficacy and the change in cystatin-C from randomization to 72 hours as a measure of renal function preservation.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In participants with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction, neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function when added to diuretic therapy.</p>",

Although evidence-based drug and device therapies decrease mortality, hospitalizations, and HF symptoms and improve quality of life, many patients treated with these regimens often remain burdened by dyspnea and fatigue, diminished exercise tolerance, reduced quality of life, recurrent hospitalizations, and early mortality.</p>\n<p>Whereas rest was traditionally recommended for HF patients, there has been evidence that physical deconditioning may play a key role in the progression of symptoms and poor outcomes. Previous studies have shown positive effects of exercise training on exercise capacity, quality of life, and biomarkers and suggest that exercise training might improve survival and decrease HF hospitalizations. Nonetheless, there remains a safety concern regarding exercise training in HF and a large scale, multicenter, controlled clinical trial was needed to provide definitive clinical outcome data.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 2,331 participants were randomized. 2,130 consented to share data with non-commercial entities, and 1,753 consented to share for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>All participants underwent baseline cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Test results were reviewed by investigators to identify significant arrhythmias or ischemia that would prevent safe exercise training, to determine appropriate levels of exercise training, and to establish training heart rate ranges. Demographics, socioeconomic status, past medical history, current medications, physical exam, and the most recent laboratory tests were obtained prior to randomization. All participants received detailed self-management educational materials which included information on medications, fluid management, symptom exacerbation, sodium intake, and physical activity.</p>\n<p>Participants randomized to the exercise training arm first participated in a structured, group-based, supervised exercise program, with a goal of 3 sessions per week for a total of 36 sessions in 3 months. The primary exercises were walking, treadmill, or stationary cycling. Exercise was initiated at 15 to 30 minutes per session at a heart rate corresponding to 60% of heart rate reserve, and was increased after 6 sessions to 30 to 35 minutes duration and 70% of heart rate reserve. Participants began home-based exercise after completing 18 supervised sessions and were to fully transition to home exercise after 36 supervised sessions. The target training regimen for home exercise was 5 times per week for 40 minutes at a heart rate of 60% to 70% of heart rate reserve.</p>\n<p>Participants randomized to the usual care group were not provided with a formal exercise prescription. To provide comparable levels of attention from study personnel, all participants were called every 2 weeks for the first 9 months, monthly until 24 months of follow-up, and quarterly thereafter.

Standard treatment for HF includes diuretics to control fluid, and drugs called \"neurohormonal antagonists\" (such as beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors) to help the heart work more efficiently. The natriuretic peptides, specifically NT-pro-BNP, are biomarkers that reflect HF severity and are significantly associated with adverse outcomes in HF. Smaller studies have evaluated adjusting HF therapy based on natriuretic peptide levels (“guided therapy”) with inconsistent results.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **A total of 894 participants were enrolled at 45 sites in the United States and Canada, with 446 randomized to the NT-pro-BNP-guided strategy treatment group and 448 randomized to the usual care treatment group.</p>\n<p>**Design: **<a href=\"https://www.guideit.com/\">GUIDE-IT</a> was a multicenter randomized clinical trial with participants randomized to either the NT-pro-BNP-guided therapy strategy or usual care.

Specific adjustments of therapy for individual participants were at the discretion of the treating physician, but sites were encouraged to prioritize titration of neurohormonal antagonists over diuretics unless there was clinical evidence of congestion or volume overload.

Epidemiologic data from middle-aged adults indicate that OSA is common, with prevalence rates of 4% in men and 2% in women. Prior studies implicated OSA as a risk factor for the development of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and consequently premature death. Questions arose as to whether an increased propensity for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases was limited to only those with frank OSA or whether more subtle forms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) would also confer elevated risk. Further evidence was also needed to clarify whether, SDB, including OSA, is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Known cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk factors such as obesity and smoking are commonly present in those with SDB; therefore, apparent associations between SDB and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases may have resulted from the effects of these concomitant risk factors. Moreover, there was no understanding as to whether such factors as race, age, gender, and prevalent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease might interact with SDB to alter future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk. Mechanisms underlying any propensity to develop cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease with SDB had not been firmly established (Quan, et al., 1997, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9493915/\">9493915</a>).</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>Participants in SHHS were recruited from nine existing NHLBI epidemiological studies in which data on cardiovascular risk factors had been collected previously.

Several cohorts over-sampled snorers in order to increase the study-wide prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. In all, 6441 individuals were enrolled between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1998.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During exam cycle 3 (January 2001-June 2003), a second polysomnogram (SHHS-2) was obtained in 3295 of the participants.</p>\n<p>Due to sovereignty issues, Strong Heart Study participants are not included in the shared SHHS data. Data from a total of 5839 participants (1920 ARIC, 1249 CHS, 997 Framingham Offspring and OMNI 1, and 1673 from other studies), consenting to share data are available.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>The Sleep Heart Health Study added in-home polysomnography to the data collected in each of the parent studies at a baseline SHHS exam and a follow-up approximately 4 years later. Using the Compumedics PS polysomnograph, sleep studies were obtained in an unattended setting, usually in the homes of the participants, by trained and certified technicians. The recording montage consisted of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C3/A2 and C4/A1 EEGs, sampled at 125 Hz - right and left electrooculograms (EOGs), sampled at 50 Hz - a bipolar submental electromyogram (EMG), sampled at 125 Hz - thoracic and abdominal excursions (THOR and ABDO), recorded by inductive plethysmography bands and sampled at 10 Hz - \"airflow\" detected by a nasal-oral thermocouple (Protec, Woodinville, WA), sampled at 10 Hz - finger-tip pulse oximetry (Nonin, Minneapolis, MN) sampled at 1 Hz - ECG from a bipolar lead, sampled at 125 Hz for most SHHS-1 studies and 250 Hz for SHHS-2 studies - Heart rate (PR) derived from the ECG and sampled at 1 Hz - body position (using a mercury gauge sensor) - ambient light (on/off, by a light sensor secured to the recording garment)\nThis montage provides data on the occurrence of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, heart rate, oximetry and on arousals. Each participant in the parent studies was also asked to complete the Sleep Habits Questionnaire which covers usual sleep pattern, snoring, and sleepiness.</li>\n</ul>",

Two approaches have been developed to prevent sudden death among patients with CHF: therapy with amiodarone and therapy with an ICD. However, most of the mortality data on amiodarone and ICD therapy at the time of the study had been obtained in clinical trials performed after myocardial infarction in patients without CHF or those with ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, more data was needed to guide these therapies in patients who did not meet these criteria.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were a total of 2521 participants. 847 were randomly assigned to placebo, 845 to amiodarone, and 829 to ICD therapy.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Before randomization, participants underwent electrocardiography, a 6-minute walk test, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography, liver and thyroid function studies, and chest radiography. Participants were required, if clinically reasonable, to receive treatment with a beta-blocker and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, as well as an aldosterone antagonist, aspirin, and statins, when appropriate. Participants were randomly assigned in equal proportions to receive placebo, amiodarone, or a single-chamber ICD programmed to shock-only mode.</p>\n<p>Participants assigned to amiodarone or matching placebo began therapy as outpatients immediately after randomization. Placebo and amiodarone were administered as a loading dose of 800 mg/day for one week, 400 mg/day for three weeks, and then as a daily maintenance dosage according to weight and bradycardia status. Participants assigned to ICD therapy received their device a median of three days after randomization. The goal of ICD therapy was to treat only rapid, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Dual-chamber or biventricular devices, or antitachycardia or rate-response pacing therapies were not permitted. The ICD was uniformly programmed to have a detection rate of 187 beats per minute or more. Antibradycardia pacing was initiated only if the intrinsic rate decreased to less than 34 beats per minute.</p>\n<p>Median follow-up was 45.5 months. The primary end point was death from any cause. Secondary outcome measures included cardiac mortality, arrhythmic mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and incremental cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Each active treatment arm was compared to the placebo drug arm.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In participants with NYHA class II or III CHF and LVEF of 35% or less, amiodarone had no favorable effect on survival, whereas single-lead, shock-only ICD therapy reduced overall mortality by 23%.</p>",

Biospecimens from TOPCAT include Buffy Coat, DNA, Plasma, Serum, Urine, and Whole Blood. Please note that use of biospecimens in genetic research is subject to a tiered consent.</p>\n<p><u>Objectives </u><br>The TOPCAT trial evaluated the effectiveness of aldosterone antagonist therapy in reducing cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, and heart failure hospitalization in patients who have heart failure with preserved systolic function.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Many patients with heart failure have a normal, or near-normal, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Such patients share similar signs and symptoms as patients who have heart failure and a reduced LVEF, as well as an impaired quality of life and a poor prognosis. However, at the time of TOPCAT, the benefit of medical therapies for heart failure were limited to those with a reduced LVEF. Due to a lack of favorable evidence from clinical trials, clinical guidelines offered no specific recommendations for the management of heart failure in patients with preserved LVEF, except for attention to coexisting conditions.</p>\n<p>Among patients with heart failure and a reduced LVEF and those with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing overall mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. In small mechanistic studies involving patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular function, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists improved measures of diastolic function. However, rigorous testing was needed regarding their effect on clinical outcomes in patients with preserved LVEF. Therefore, the TOPCAT trial was initiated to determine whether treatment with spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, would improve clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a relatively preserved LVEF.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 3445 participants were enrolled, with 1722 assigned to the spironolactone group and 1723 assigned to the placebo group. Among these, 2464 participants were enrolled via the hospitalization stratum and 981 were enrolled via the BNP stratum.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>TOPCAT was a phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled trial. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive either spironolactone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified according to whether the patient met the criterion for previous hospitalization or BNP elevation. The baseline visit included assessment of socio-demographics, physical characteristics, medical history, lifestyle factors, laboratory measures, electrocardiography variables and health-related quality of life and functional status.</p>\n<p>Study drugs were initially administered at a dose of 15 mg once daily, which was increased as tolerated to a maximum of 45 mg daily during the first four months after randomization. Subsequent dose adjustments were made as required and subjects continued to receive other treatments for heart failure and co-existing illnesses. Measurement of potassium and creatinine levels was required within 1 week after a change in the study-drug dose and at each scheduled study visit. Follow-up visits to monitor symptoms, medications, and events and to dispense study drug were scheduled every four months during the subject's first year on the study, and every six months thereafter. The mean follow-up interval was 3.3 years in each study group. Repository blood and urine samples were collected at the baseline and 1 year visits from consenting subjects.</p>\n<p>The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure management, new onset of diabetes mellitus or atrial fibrillation, and quality of life.</p>\n<p>A subset of subjects also participated in the Echocardiography or Echocardiography and Vascular Stiffness ancillary studies. Echocardiography, and additionally tonometry in the Echocardiography and Vascular Stiffness study, were performed at baseline and at either 12 or 18 months following randomization. If the subject was already enrolled in the TOPCAT trial at the time the ancillary study was initiated, but had not yet reached the 18 month visit, baseline was determined via a retrospective analysis performed on any echocardiographic images completed within 60 days prior to TOPCAT enrollment and no tonometry was performed if applicable.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. However, the drug reduced the secondary endpoint of heart failure hospitalization incidence.</p>",

However, there are no proven effective medical treatments for this syndrome. Evidence suggests that impairments in nitric oxide availability have a potentially important role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p>\n<p>Unlike organic nitrates, inorganic nitrite is converted to nitric oxide in the presence of hypoxia and acidosis, conditions that develop during exercise. Because the cardiac, vascular, and skeletal muscle abnormalities that limit physical capacity and contribute to symptoms in patients with HFpEF characteristically develop during exercise, inorganic nitrite may provide the best way to target nitric oxide delivery precisely at the time of greatest need. The HFN-INDIE trial was initiated to test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, longer-term use of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite would enhance peak exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 105 participants were randomized. 53 were randomized to receive nitrite first and 52 were randomized to receive placebo first.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>HFN-INDIE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After enrollment, patients underwent baseline studies to determine eligibility. All patients were required to display objective exercise limitation, evidenced by reduced peak oxygen consumption (V̇O<sub>2</sub>) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing of less than 75% predicted, with a respiratory exchange ratio indicative of maximal effort (≥1.0). Following qualifying exercise testing, eligible participants received an open-label, single-dose run-in of inhaled, nebulized sodium nitrite (80 mg) to assess tolerability, symptoms, and orthostatic vital signs. Patients developing hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x3C;90 mm Hg seated or standing), light-headedness, or any other intolerance were categorized as a run-in failure and were not randomized. Following the baseline studies, eligible patients were randomly assigned to either receive nitrite first or to receive placebo first. Study drug was administered 3 times a day by nebulizer. During each 6-week period, patients were instructed to take no study drug for the first 2 weeks (baseline phase during the first period and washout phase during the second period), followed by 46 mg 3 times daily for 1 week, and then 80 mg 3 times daily for 3 weeks.

Accelerometry, health-related quality-of-life scores on the self-administered Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), echocardiographic indicators of cardiac filling pressures measured at trough drug levels (E/e' ratio, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left atrial volume index; lower scores indicate better health for all), ventilatory efficiency (VE/V̇co2, lower indicating better health), exercise time (higher indicating better health), and NT-proBNP levels (lower indicating better health) were also collected.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>Among patients with HFpEF, administration of inhaled inorganic nitrite for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity.</p>\n<p>Borlaug et al., 2018, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30398602\">30398602</a>.</p>",

Access differs from many other dbGaP accessions.</p>\n<p><u>Objectives</u><br>This study was initiated in 1986, primarily to evaluate the effects of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, on long-term mortality and major morbidity in a group of participants with left ventricular dysfunction. Two large separate trials were run concurrently as part of SOLVD: 1) a prevention trial of participants with low ejection fraction but no overt symptoms of CHF and, 2) a treatment trial of participants with low ejection fraction and symptoms of CHF. In addition, participants at selected sites were entered into substudies to evaluate the effect of enalapril on a number of intermediate outcomes such as right and left ventricular function and hemodynamics, LV mass and wall stress, hormones, arrhythmias, exercise capacity, and quality of life in subsets of participants. Lastly, a registry of 6,336 participants with congestive heart failure of LV dysfunction was designed to describe the clinical course of an unselected group of participants.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a major and increasingly recognized public health problem. The recognition that participants with CHF often have elevated peripheral vascular resistance has led to the introduction of vasodilator therapy, which has emerged as an important component of its treatment. Of the vasodilators, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appeared to be the most promising. In 1985, little was known about the impact of any long-term drug treatment on survival.</p>\n<p>SOLVD Registry: The SOLVD Registry is a hospital-based observational study, conducted at selected SOLVD hospitals, of participants with at least moderate left-ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤ 45%) and/or radiologically confirmed heart failure. It consists of a main study (n=6,273) and a substudy (n=898). Although there is overlap between the Registry and the SOLVD trials, the Registry sample is not a subset of SOLVD nor is it the pool of participants eligible for both trials.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 2,569 participants were enrolled into the treatment study and 4,228 participants were enrolled in the prevention study. The dataset available through the NHLBI contains the prevention and treatment study data as well as the registry data.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In the prevention trial, a significant reduction in the incidence of heart failure and the rate of related hospitalizations was observed for participants in the enalapril arm. A statistically significant reduction in mortality was not observed in the enalapril treatment arm; however, there was a trend toward fewer total deaths and deaths due to cardiovascular causes among the enalapril participants (SOLVD Investigators, et al., 1992, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1463530/\">1463530</a>).</p>",

Specific aims included: to establish whether the results of Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) trials can be generalized to the larger population of participants that experience cardiac arrest; to more fully establish the burden of cardiac arrest; and to examine the relationships between variation in EMS structure and process, regional and periodic factors, and participant outcomes.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Cardiac arrest is a common, serious, debilitating and costly public health problem. Although there has been a steady decline in morbidity and mortality from most cardiovascular diseases, high mortality rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests continue to pose a challenge for healthcare providers and a significant public health burden. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was established in 2004 to conduct clinical research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury with the overall goal of improving resuscitation outcomes. Participant and care characteristics can predict favorable outcomes in cardiac arrests, but there is still a wide variation in outcomes that is not well understood. EMS factors such as service level, number of responding providers, use of procedures or drugs in the field, training, quality assurance/feedback, and response time intervals also vary significantly by region. Variations in geographic, socioeconomic and periodic factors may also be associated with differences in outcomes.</p>\n<p>Prior to ROC Cardiac Epistry, there were no North American population-based registries for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Therefore there was a need for standardized data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in diverse geographic locations in order to identify the independent effects of prognostic or treatment factors accounting for variations in survival.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were 120,306 participants.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>ROC Epistry collected standardized data regarding episode-specific factors, participant demographics, clinical information, pre-hospital interventions and disposition, hospital information, and participant outcome for all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the ROC regions. Each ROC site had to ensure capture of all eligible cases within the EMS service areas. Out-of-hospital data were extracted from existing databases whenever possible and augmented with targeted review of EMS reports. Hospital data were abstracted directly from the hospital file in most cases. Alternative methods included linkage to death registries and obituaries if the death occurred within 30 days. Sites submitted data using a web-based interface or batch uploads. Participants were not contacted directly.</p>",

An excessive inflammatory response is characteristic of ALI of which ARDS represents the most severe end of the pathophysiologic spectrum. The inflammatory response includes increased numbers of neutrophils activated to produce cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen intermediates. Pulmonary injury may also be enhanced by alveolar and tissue macrophages as a producer of vasoactive substances, neutrophil chemoattractants, and procoagulant substances. Ketoconazole, a synthetic antifungal imidazole, also has anti-inflammatory activities and may inhibit neutrophil recruitment via several different pathways known to be involved in the development of ALI and ARDS. Lisofylline causes a marked decrease in the circulating levels of the major oxidizable species of free fatty acids and also inhibits proinflammatory intracellular signaling. Mechanical ventilation in participants with ALI and ARDS have traditionally used tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight. These large tidal volumes are often necessary to achieve normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH, but may induce inflammatory responses through disruption of pulmonary epithelium and endothelium. Mechanical ventilation at lower tidal volumes may reduce injurious lung stretch and decrease the inflammatory response.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>The Ketoconazole and Lisofylline trials were designed as 2 x 2 factorials and included 220 participants in each trial.

Fluid leaks from blood vessels into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. Recovery from this form of acute respiratory failure requires that the pulmonary edema resolve. The resolution of alveolar edema is driven by active transport of sodium and chloride ions from the luminal space across both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, creating an osmotic gradient for the reabsorption of water. In the ex vivo human lung, the rate of alveolar fluid clearance can be doubled by treatment with a cyclic AMP beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.</p>\n<p>On the basis of the preclinical observations that treatment with beta-2-agonists could reduce pulmonary edema and accelerate the rate of alveolar fluid clearance, the ALTA study was designed and undertaken with the hypothesis that treatment of participants with ALI/ARDS with beta-agonist therapy would accelerate the resolution of alveolar edema and improve clinical outcomes.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were 282 participants.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Study staff conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which participants were randomized to receive aerosolized albuterol (5 mg) or saline placebo every 4 hours for up to 10 days.

The type and inflammatory activity of eicosanoids liberated during inflammation depends on the membrane phospholipid composition: omega 6 (n-6) fatty acid arachidonate yields highly reactive and inflammatory dienoic prostaglandins and series 4 leukotrienes, whereas omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids favor production of less active and potentially anti-inflammatory trienoic prostaglandins and series 5 leukotrienes. Participants at risk of developing ALI have n-3 levels approximately 25% of normal and those with established ALI have n-3 levels as low as 6% of normal, suggesting a potential role for n-3 dietary supplementation in participants with ALI.</p>\n<p>Three randomized controlled studies, conducted in participants with ALI or sepsis-induced respiratory failure, demonstrated an association between the administration of an enteral formula enriched in n-3 fatty acids, GLA, and antioxidants and improved oxygenation and respiratory physiology compared with an unenriched, high-fat formula.

The majority of these deaths result from hypovolemic shock or severe brain injury. Participants in hypovolemic shock develop a state of systemic tissue ischemia then a subsequent reperfusion injury at the time of fluid resuscitation. Conventional resuscitation involves the IV administration of a large volume of isotonic or slightly hypotonic (lactated ringers, LR) solutions beginning in the prehospital setting. Although not conclusive, prior studies have suggested that alternative resuscitation with hypertonic saline (7.5%) solutions may reduce morbidity or mortality in these participants. Furthermore, hypertonic fluids may have specific advantages in the brain-injured participant, as they may aid in the rapid restoration of cerebral perfusion and prevent extravascular fluid sequestration, thereby limiting secondary brain injury. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that hypertonicity significantly alters the activation of inflammatory cells, an effect that may reduce subsequent organ injury from ischemia-reperfusion and decrease nosocomial infection. The majority of previous clinical trials have focused on the use of HSD. The potential for 7.5% saline alone (HS) to have similar effects has not been well studied. Removal of the dextran component may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of this solution, which could improve secondary outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) and rates of nosocomial infections.</p>\n<p><u>**Participants **</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Shock:** <strong>There were 893 participants that were randomized (853 enrolled).- TBI:</strong> **There were 1282 participants enrolled and 6-month outcomes data were available for 1087 (85%).\n<u>**Design **</u></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shock:** <strong>Multicenter, randomized, blinded clinical trials involving 114 emergency medical services agencies in North America within the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium were conducted from May 2006 to August 2008.

Although sedation therapy benefits young participants who cannot understand the imperative nature of invasive life-sustaining therapies, sedative use is also associated with untoward adverse effects. Specifically, opioids and benzodiazepines commonly used for pediatric sedation may impair bedside neurological assessment, depress spontaneous ventilation, and prolong mechanical ventilation. Over time, drug tolerance develops, which may precipitate iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome when sedation therapy is no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>Numerous studies in adult critical care support a minimal yet effective approach to sedation management. Sedation goals for mechanically ventilated adults have shifted from an unresponsive state to a calm, easily aroused, readily evaluated participant. Studies in adult participants evaluating targeted sedation, daily interruption and/or titration of sedation, pairing of spontaneous awakening with breathing, and no sedation have reported improved clinical outcomes, including decreased length of mechanical ventilation when compared with usual care.</p>\n<p>In contrast, few data inform sedation practices in pediatric critical care, and international studies describe significant practice variation. Given unique biobehavioral differences, knowledge generated in adult critical care may not translate to the care of critically ill children. The RESTORE study was conducted to test the effect of a nurse-implemented, goal-directed sedation protocol on clinical outcomes in pediatric participants with acute respiratory failure.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Participants</strong></u> There was a total of 2,449 participants (mean age: 4.7 years; range: 2 weeks to 17 years).</p>\n<p><u><strong>Design</strong></u> The RESTORE study was a cluster randomized clinical trial conducted in 31 US PICUs. Intervention PICUs (17 sites; 1,225 participants) used a protocol that included targeted sedation, arousal assessments, extubation readiness testing, sedation adjustment every 8 hours, and sedation weaning. Control PICUs (14 sites; 1,224 participants) managed sedation per usual care. The primary outcome variable was duration of mechanical ventilation.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Conclusions</strong></u> Among children undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, the use of a sedation protocol compared with usual care did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation. Exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes suggest a complex relationship among wakefulness, pain, and agitation (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602358/\">JAMA 2015; 313(4):379-89</a>).</p>",

As a result, low–tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is now recommended for all patients with ARDS, although penetration of this evidence-based practice has been limited, especially early in mechanical ventilation. LTVV may also benefit patients without ARDS. Consequently, there has been increasing call to apply LTVV for all patients with acute respiratory failure upon initiation of mechanical ventilation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://petalnet.org/\">PETAL Network</a> considered performing a pragmatic stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized, controlled, hybrid implementation trial to examine systematic implementation of a default 6 ml/kg PBW LTVV strategy in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation to improve adherence to LTVV and decrease mortality in acute respiratory failure. Trial planning may be better estimated by simulation than routine, simplistic calculations, but such simulations require detailed data of initial parameters.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> 2848 patients from 49 hospitals were enrolled. Enrollment varied by hospital, ranging from 4 to 100 patients, the maximum enrollment allowed per site.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design:</u></strong> <a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_lotus_fruit/\">PETAL-LOTUS FRUIT</a> was a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation in the PETAL Network hospitals.</p>\n<p>For all patients, baseline demographic data, the hospital location, indication for intubation (hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure or both, altered level of consciousness, or surgery), type of intensive care unit (ICU), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in the first 24 hours after intubation were collected. Baseline ventilator data immediately after intubation, arterial blood gas results and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry, and presence of ARDS was also collected for all patients. ARDS was defined as a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) less than or equal to 300 with a chest radiograph within 24 hours of the qualifying ratio of arterial oxygen tension to FiO2 that had bilateral infiltrates unexplained by mass, collapse, or effusion. For the first 50 patients enrolled at each hospital, daily data on ventilator mode, Vt, and presence of ARDS for the first 3 days after intubation was collected. Vt indexed to PBW was calculated from the set Vt for patients on ventilator mode with volume settings. For patients on pressure ventilation modes, Vt was calculated from the ratio of minute ventilation (in ml/min) to the respiratory rate. Enrolled patients were followed until hospital discharge or 28 days for clinical outcomes including mortality, ventilator-free days, and length of stay.</p>\n<p>To determine the possible improvement in mortality that could be observed with a reduction in Vt from current usual care in the <a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_lotus_fruit/\">PETAL-LOTUS FRUIT</a> cohort to 6 ml/kg PBW, mortality was estimated as a function of initial Vt. Five models based on data from three distinct patient populations were used. 500 simulations of a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized clinical trial using the model with greatest predicted benefit for lowering the Vt to 6 ml/kg PBW in <a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_lotus_fruit/\">PETAL-LOTUS FRUIT</a> sites were performed.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions:</u></strong> Use of initial tidal volumes less than 8 ml/kg predicted body weight was common at hospitals participating in the <a href=\"https://petalnet.org/\">PETAL Network</a>. After considering the size and budgetary requirement for a cluster-randomized trial of LTVV versus usual care in acute respiratory failure, the <a href=\"https://petalnet.org/\">PETAL Network</a> deemed the proposed trial infeasible (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30407869/\">PMID: 30407869</a>).</p>",

Although there has been a steady decline in morbidity and mortality from most cardiovascular diseases, high mortality rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests continue to pose a challenge for healthcare providers and a significant public health burden. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was established in 2004 to conduct clinical research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury with the overall goal of improving resuscitation outcomes. Participant and care characteristics can predict favorable outcomes in cardiac arrests, but there is still a wide variation in outcomes that is not well understood. EMS factors such as service level, number of responding providers, use of procedures or drugs in the field, training, quality assurance/feedback, and response time intervals also vary significantly by region. Variations in geographic, socioeconomic and periodic factors may also be associated with differences in outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prior to ROC Cardiac Epistry, there were no North American population-based registries for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

Each ROC site had to ensure capture of all eligible cases within the EMS service areas. Out-of-hospital data were extracted from existing databases whenever possible and augmented with targeted review of EMS reports. Hospital data were abstracted directly from the hospital file in most cases. Alternative methods included linkage to death registries and obituaries if the death occurred within 30 days.

The majority of seriously injured persons are initially evaluated and cared for by prehospital providers, however the effect of EMS systems, EMS clinical care, and EMS interventions on trauma patient outcomes is largely unknown. EMS factors such as service level, number of responding providers, use of procedures or drugs in the field, training, quality assurance/feedback, and response time intervals also vary significantly by region.</p>\n<p>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was established in 2004 to conduct clinical research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury with the overall goal of improving resuscitation outcomes. Previous trauma registries have generally focused primarily on hospitalized patients with limited prehospital information. Registries may also exclude trauma cases at far ends of the spectrum, such as those who die in the field or in a non-trauma center and/or patients that are treated and released. These limitations do not allow for detailed, outcome-based assessments of EMS system factors necessary to define prehospital resuscitation best practices. Therefore there was a need for standardized data collection of out-of-hospital traumatic injuries matched to hospital-based outcomes in diverse geographic locations in order to identify the independent effects of prognostic or treatment factors accounting for variations in survival.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u>: The registry included 13,830 traumatic events from 264 EMS agencies transporting to 287 acute care hospitals from the following regional centers: Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas, Texas; Iowa City, Iowa; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; San Diego, California; Seattle/King County, Washington; Ottawa, Ontario; Toronto, Ontario; and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u>: ROC Epistry collected standardized data regarding episode-specific factors, participant demographics, clinical information, pre-hospital interventions and disposition, hospital information, and participant outcome for all out-of-hospital traumatic injuries in the ROC regions.

Rhabdoid tumors are a rare, very aggressive type of kidney tumor of infancy, and patients typically have a poor prognosis. Up to 40 patient cases of matched tumor and normal samples, as well as some established cell lines, will undergo whole genome sequencing, miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq, DNA methyl-seq and ChIP-seq to generate a comprehensive profile and hopefully facilitate the development of better therapeutic options for this tumor subtype.

    "description": "<p>FLT3 mutations are commonly detected in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients and are associated with poor prognosis. Crenolanib, a potent type I pan-FLT3 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=FLT3\">GeneID:2322</a>) inhibitor, is effective against both internal tandem duplications (ITD) and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. While crenolanib monotherapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory AML patients, responses are transient and relapse eventually occurs. To investigate the mechanisms of crenolanib resistance, we performed whole exome sequencing of AML patient samples before and after crenolanib treatment (122 samples from 59 patients). Unlike other FLT3 inhibitors, crenolanib did not induce FLT3 activation loop mutations, and mutations of the FLT3 \"gatekeeper\" residue were infrequent. Instead, mutations of NRAS (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NRAS\">GeneID:4893</a>) and IDH2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IDH2\">GeneID:3418</a>) arose, mostly as FLT3-independent subclones, while TET2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=TET2\">GeneID:54790</a>) and IDH1 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IDH1\">GeneID:3417</a>) predominantly co-occurred with the FLT3-mutant clone and were enriched in crenolanib poor-responders. The remaining patients exhibited post-crenolanib expansion of mutations associated with epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and cohesion factors, suggesting diverse non-FLT3 genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of crenolanib resistance. Drug combinations in experimental models restored crenolanib sensitivity.</p>",

The initial findings from the Beat AML program were from a cohort of 672 tumor specimens collected from 562 patients. Additional patients have been added in subsequent versions. We assessed these specimens using whole exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and ex vivo drug sensitivity analyses. Our data reveal novel mutational events not previously detected in AML. We show association of drug response with mutational status, including instances of drug sensitivity that are specific to combinatorial mutational events. Integration with RNA-sequencing also revealed gene expression signatures, which predict a role of specific gene networks in drug response. Collectively, this report offers a dataset, accessible by the Beat AML data viewer (<a href=\"www.vizome.org\">www.vizome.org</a>), that can be leveraged to address clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and functional inquiries into the biology of AML.</p>",

The goal is to create a publicly available dataset of genomic, molecular, clinical, and patient-reported data to enable research. Patients in the US or Canada may register online. Registered patients are sent an online consent form that asks for permission to obtain and analyze their medical records, tumor tissue, saliva, and blood samples. Once enrolled, patients are sent a saliva kit and asked to mail back a saliva sample, which is used to extract germline DNA. Study staff contact participants' medical providers and obtain medical records and a portion of their stored tumor biopsies. Patients may be asked to mail in a blood sample, which is used to extract cell free DNA (cfDNA). Whole exome sequencing (WES) is performed on tumor DNA, germline DNA, and cfNDA; transcriptome sequencing is performed on tumor RNA. Clinically annotated genomic data are used to study specific patient cohorts (including outliers) and to identify mechanisms of response and resistance to therapies. All de-identified data, including genomic, clinical, and patient-reported data, are shared via public databases on a pre-publication and recurring basis as it is generated.

The aim of this program is the retrospective characterization and analysis of biospecimens collected from completed NCI-sponsored trials of the National Clinical Trials Network and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. This study, titled \"Comprehensive Genomic Profiling to Identify Alterations Associated with Relapse for NCI Standard Risk (SR) B-Lineage ALL and NCI High Risk (HR) B-Lineage ALL with Favorable Genetic Features,\" is one of the selected studies under this program. For this study, genomic characterization (WGS 30X, WXS, Total RNAseq) was performed on NCI Standard Risk B-lineage ALL patients who relapse and subsets of NCI High Risk B-lineage ALL patients who relapse as well as two non-relapse control cases for each relapse case. It was hypothesized that the comprehensive characterization of these sample sets will allow the identification of somatic genetic features that will facilitate early intervention to improve cure rates for those enrolled on future trials. Data were generated and genetic subtype was integrated with clinical variables, including age, presenting white blood cell count, sex, race, and levels of minimal residual disease at the end of induction. Additional secondary alterations were identified and included if they occurred in more than 10 patients. The study has been completed and a manuscript has been prepared.</p>",

Marazita of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, including collaborations with Dr. George Wehby of the University of Iowa, Dr. Jacqueline Hecht of the University of Texas, and Dr. Terri Beaty of Johns Hopkins University. Sequencing was done by the Washington University McDonell Genome Institute. The case in each of the Kids First trios has cleft lip (CL, Figure A), cleft palate (CP, Figure B), or both (CL+CP, Figure C):</p>\n<p>OFCs are genetically complex structural birth defects caused by genetic factors, environmental exposures, and their interactions. OFCs are the most common craniofacial anomalies in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 700 newborns, and are one of the most common structural birth defects worldwide. On average a child with an OFC initially faces feeding difficulties, undergoes 6 surgeries, spends 30 days in hospital, receives 5 years of orthodontic treatment, and participates in ongoing speech therapy, leading to an estimated total lifetime treatment cost of about $200,000. Further, individuals born with an OFC have higher infant mortality, higher mortality rates at all other stages of life, increased incidence of mental health problems, and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers). Prior genome-wide linkage and association studies have now identified at least 18 genomic regions likely to contribute to the risk for nonsyndromic OFCs. Despite this substantial progress, the functional/pathogenic variants at OFC-associated regions are mostly still unknown. Because previous OFC genomic studies (genome-wide linkage, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and targeted sequencing) are based on relatively sparse genotyping data, they cannot distinguish between causal variants and variants in linkage disequilibrium with unobserved causal variants. Moreover, it is unknown whether the association or linkage signals are due to single common variants, haplotypes of multiple common variants, clusters of multiple rare variants, or some combination. Finally, we cannot yet attribute specific genetic risk to individual cases and case families. <strong>Therefore, the goal of the current study is to identify specific OFC risk variants in Whites by performing whole genome sequencing of parent-case trios.</strong></p>",

This program focuses on gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects and the development of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Data Resource (Kids First Data Resource). Both childhood cancers and structural birth defects are critical and costly conditions associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) are congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. DSD are chronic medical conditions collectively affecting ~1% of the population, frequently requiring life-long care by multiple specialists, and carrying a significant public health burden. Some are associated with life-threatening events, such as adrenal crises in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). DSD are also associated with increased infertility, cancer, gender dysphoria risks, psychosocial distress and pervasive challenges to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients and families. DSD are broadly classified into three categories: sex chromosome DSD, 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD, and further classified according to the type of gonad found in the patient (ovary, testis, ovotestis).</p>\n<p>We were able to increase significantly the diagnostic success for DSD using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), with the identification of disease-causing and likely pathogenic variants in a third of a cohort of 46,XY patients. We have therefore proposed a shift in the diagnostic approach to DSD to use next-gen sequencing as a first-line clinical test, which could lead to faster and more accurate diagnosis, and orient further clinical management, limiting unnecessary, costly, and often invasive endocrine testing and imaging. However many remain unexplained (over half of the XY cases, a significant minority of XX cases, including most ovotesticular DSD, and most syndromic cases). In addition, the very large phenotypic variability in cases with known variants in the same gene is unexplained.</p>\n<p>We here propose to use Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS), which dramatically improves upon exome sequencing, covering both coding and non-coding parts of the genome more uniformly, as an approach to not only improve diagnostic yield, but also to identify novel genes and regulatory elements involved in DSD.</p>",

Mounting evidence suggests that a genetic predisposition exists for this pediatric cancer, although the specific genetic contribution has yet to be identified. EWS has never been linked to a specific cancer predisposition syndrome, although several case reports have been published that describe siblings and cousins with EWS. Furthermore, neuroectodermal tumors appear to occur more commonly in families with EWS. The two consistent epidemiology findings in EWS include a very strong Caucasian predilection and increased rates of hernia in EWS patients and their family members. Finally, the role of genetic microsatellite repeats in EWS tumorigenesis has been recently described, and these GGAA microsatellites are polymorphic in repeat size and location across the genome.<br></p>\n<p>The study goals of this Kids First project include (1) To identify cancer predisposition genes in EWS trios increasing disease risk, (2) To identify genome-wide GGAA microsatellite repeats in EWS trios increasing disease risk, and (3) To identity de novo mutation and structural variant rates in EWS trios reflecting underlying DNA repair defects that increase disease risk. As part of the Kids First Common Fund initiative, this study proposal will further elucidate the genetic contribution to pediatric cancer development. Around 375 of these trios were selected for whole genome sequencing as part of the Gabriella Miller Kids First fund. The EWS trios have been collected as part of the Children's Oncology Group's AEPI10N5 Study (\"Genetic Epidemiology of Ewing Sarcoma\"), and each trio has associated phenotypic data including a detailed family history. We will interrogate the sequence data using our genomic analysis pipeline at the University of Utah and the Utah Science Technology and Research initiative's (USTAR) Center for Genetic Discovery.

Marazita of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics, and including a collaboration with Dr. Lina Moreno Uribe and Dr. Andrew Lidral of the University of Iowa. All families were ascertained through the Clinica Noel where patients with OFCs receive care from the Antioquia University School of Dentistry in Medellin, Colombia (key on-site colleagues included Dr. Luz Consuelo Valencia-Ramirez and Dr. Mauricio Arcos-Burgos). Genetic studies have shown that this population is comprised of an admixture of immigrant male Caucasians (mainly Spaniards and Basques) and native Amerindian females. Every subject has had a genetic evaluation, including a pedigree analysis for a family history of clefting and other birth defects, a pregnancy history for environmental exposures, and a complete physical exam to rule out suspected or known syndromes or environmental phenocopies. Sequencing was done by the Broad Institute sequencing center funded by the Kids First program (grant number U24-HD090743). The case in each of the Kids First OFC trios has cleft lip (CL, Figure A below), cleft palate (CP, Figure B), or both (CL+CP, Figure C):<br></p>\n<p>OFCs are genetically complex structural birth defects caused by genetic factors, environmental exposures, and their interactions. OFCs are the most common craniofacial anomalies in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 700 newborns, and are one of the most common structural birth defects worldwide. On average a child with an OFC initially faces feeding difficulties, undergoes 6 surgeries, spends 30 days in hospital, receives 5 years of orthodontic treatment, and participates in ongoing speech therapy, leading to an estimated total lifetime treatment cost of about $200,000. Further, individuals born with an OFC have higher infant mortality, higher mortality rates at all other stages of life, increased incidence of mental health problems, and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers). Prior genome-wide linkage and association studies have now identified at least 18 genomic regions likely to contribute to the risk for nonsyndromic OFCs. Despite this substantial progress, the functional/pathogenic variants at OFC-associated regions are mostly still unknown. Because previous OFC genomic studies (genome-wide linkage, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and targeted sequencing) are based on relatively sparse genotyping data, they cannot distinguish between causal variants and variants in linkage disequilibrium with unobserved causal variants.

The <em>long-term goal</em> of our research program is to ultimately improve neuroblastoma cure rates by first comprehensively defining the genetic basis of the disease. The <em>central hypothesis</em> to be tested here is that neuroblastoma arises largely due to the epistatic interaction of common and rare heritable DNA variation. Here we will perform a comprehensive whole genome sequencing of 563 quartets of neuroblastoma patient germline and diagnostic tumor DNAs and germline DNAs from both parents. The case series was recently collected through a Children's Oncology Group epidemiology clinical trial and is robustly annotated with complete demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity), clinical (e.g. age at diagnosis, stage, risk group), epidemiologic (parental dietary and exposure questionnaire) and biological (e.g. tumor <em>MYCN</em> status and multiple other tumor genomic measures) co-variates. Subjects were consented for genetic research and DNA is immediately available for shipment for sequencing. We propose Illumina-based whole genome sequencing in the 593 \"trio\" germline samples (<strong>Aim 1</strong>; due to missing parent: 487 full neuroblastoma triads, 106 child-single parent dyads = 1673 whole genome sequences) and matched diagnostic tumor DNA (<strong>Aim 2</strong>; N=366) at 30x sequencing depth (N=2039 whole genome sequences). Also in Aim 2 we will perform whole exome (100x) and RNA sequencing on the 366 tumor DNA and 228 tumor RNA samples from this cohort. Finally, we propose a pilot study of structural variation using long-range sequencing in 10 non-overlapping tumor samples chosen based on potentially relevant chromosomal alterations discovered with conventional NGS. Thus, a total of 2277 individual samples and 2655 sequences will be generated. We will use our established analytic pipeline that is currently being used to study the germline genomes of all cases sequenced through the NCI supported Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments program. We plan a three-stage analytic approach, first focusing on classic <em>de novo</em> and inherited Mendelian damaging alterations. We will next integrate our extensive epigenomic data from human neuroblastoma cell lines and genome-wide association study data (N=5,703 neuroblastoma cases to date) to guide a comprehensive assessment of noncoding variants that influence tumor initiation with a recently established analytic pipeline. Finally, we will utilize the tumor DNA analyses to inform relevance via somatic gain or loss of function effects at the sequence and/or copy number levels. All data generated in this project will be immediately placed into the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) and we will compute within this environment by importing our analytic pipelines into the GDC. These data will be fully integrated into the Kids First Data Resource and freely shared with all academically qualified petitioners. This comprehensive data set derived from a large and richly phenotyped series of neuroblastoma DNA quartets will be integrated with existing germline and/or tumor genomic data from over 6,000 neuroblastoma subjects (but none with matched patient-parent germline sequencing data) to provide an unparalleled opportunity to comprehensively discover the genetic basis of neuroblastoma.<br></p>",

It accounts for about 20% of bone tumors and is diagnosed in approximately 600 patients each year in the United States. Up to 40% of the chondrosarcomas arise from an enchondroma. Enchondromas are benign, intramedullary cartilaginous tumors of bone. They can be solitary or multiple and are present in >3% of the population. Enchondromatosis refers to a group of diseases characterized by multiple enchondromas including metachondromatosis (MC), Ollier disease (OD), and Maffucci syndrome (MS) among others. All have skeletal abnormalities with or without associated vascular anomalies that can cause severe limb deformities during early childhood. The risk for chondrosarcoma is up to 30% in OD and MS. Currently, the only treatment for patients with these disorders is surgical; there is no effective pharmacologic therapy. The molecular bases of these two conditions is not well understood.</p>",

The severity of microtia is variable and ranges from subtle deformities in the pinna to absence of the external ear. Microtia is often associated with closure of the external auditory ear canal causing significant hearing loss. Microtia can be an isolated, unilateral or bilateral malformation, or occur solely with ear canal deformities, or with additional craniofacial or syndromic manifestations. Earlier studies of identical twins with microtia demonstrated a significant genetic contribution. The molecular pathogenesis for most microtia remains unknown. We propose to leverage our clinical acumen in diagnosis and treatment of microtia (R.E.), our relationship to the microtia community (M.T.) and our collected DNA samples from microtia patients to identify genetic variant(s) that contribute to this congenital malformation. Microtia prevalence is much higher among Native Americans and some Latin Americans (17 per 10000 Ecuadorian births) than among individuals of European-descent (0.6 -1.6 per 10,000 births). To capitalize on this epidemiologic data, we have recruited microtia cohorts from Latin America and the U.S, including clinical data and DNA samples.</p>",

Our approach to tease out genetic contributions to birth defects has been to identify the underlying causes of syndromic birth defects which are often Mendelian in nature and therefore lend themselves more readily to genetic causal identification. Once identified, these genetic causes of syndromic forms of birth defects can be leveraged to understand the genetic contributions to isolated birth defects seen in constellation in syndromes such as CdLS. This work will lead to the identification of genes critical in human embryonic development, provide novel insights into transcriptional regulation and help to identify genetic causes and candidate genes for isolated birth defects seen in constellation in similar diagnoses.</p>",

Thus, the primary goal in the treatment of T-ALL is to prevent relapse, which requires accurate risk stratification. Unfortunately, no genetic alterations have been identified to date that are reproducibly prognostic independent of minimal residual disease (MRD), making it difficult at diagnosis to identify which patients are more likely to relapse. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813610/\">AALL0434</a> was a Children's Oncology Group-initiated phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing Capizzi-style escalating methotrexate plus pegaspargase (CMTX) vs. high dose methotrexate (HDMTX), with/without six 5-day courses of nelarabine. Survival on this study was superior to any prior trial for <em>de novo</em> T-ALL, changing the standard of care. Yet, a substantial minority (~15%) of patients had relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. Through the TARGET initiative, RNA sequencing, DNA copy number analysis, and whole-exome sequencing were performed on 264 T-ALL patients treated on AALL0434, demonstrating recurrent alterations could be grouped into 10 different potentially targetable functional pathways. This analysis was not powered to examine associations between genetic lesions with outcome, because too few patients with r/r disease were included. This project is dedicated to testing the hypothesis that comprehensive genomic profiling of the entire AALL0434 cohort will identify recurrent genetic alterations that can be segregated into biologically relevant deregulated pathways that can be combined with MRD to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes before they relapse and provide rationale for treatment with alternative therapies. In addition, a number of small recent studies demonstrated that many of the biologically relevant alterations in T-ALL occur in non-coding regions of the genome, but no large studies have performed whole genome sequencing in T-ALL. This project also tests the hypothesis that whole genome sequencing of a large cohort of patients with T-ALL will identify novel lesions in coding and non-coding regions that will be highly impactful in the understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis. These hypotheses are tested by performing comprehensive genomic profiling (whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and copy number analysis) of the entire AALL0434 cohort with available samples with the following specific aims: (1) identify recurrent genetic alterations that predict poor outcome in T-ALL; (2) identify novel alterations, including non-coding alterations in T-ALL; and (3) identify germline genetic variants that predispose to T-ALL and to increased toxicity to chemotherapy.</p>",

Gut malrotation, biliary atresia, asplenia or polysplenia, complex cardiovascular malformations, and midline defects such as neural tube defects, vertebral anomalies and rib fusions are found in various combinations in patients with laterality defects. In addition, a subset of laterality defects caused by abnormalities of cilia position or function are associated with additional medical problems such as chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis that require specific preventive care; however these patients frequently are undiagnosed until late in disease course. The goal of this project is to elucidate the genetic architecture of laterality disorders in order to inform medical management and risk stratification and to prevent complications. Laterality disorders are genetically heterogeneous and we and others have previously identified single nucleotide variants inherited in an X-linked or autosomal recessive manner as explanations for a minority of cases. In addition, we have demonstrated copy number variants (CNVs) as a mechanism of disease that requires additional investigation. We hypothesize that the majority of cases result from complex genetic inheritance. We propose to investigate this hypothesis using a multifaceted analysis approach in our extremely well phenotyped cohort of 538 probands with laterality disorders. Nested within this cohort are 105 trios who have not had previous sequencing, probands who have had exome sequencing and are excellent candidates for gene discovery <em>via</em> whole genome sequencing (WGS), and families with multiple affected family members for family-based analysis. All trios will be analyzed by transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) including rare variant TDT. <em>De novo</em> mutations will also be identified from trios for potential gene discovery. Using all probands, we will identify the prevalence of pathogenic CNVs. In addition, we will perform burden analyses to identify genes, gene interactions, and pathways important for susceptibility to laterality disorders. Finally, our rare families with multiple affected members will be studied using family based segregation analysis. This comprehensive genetic analysis in patients with laterality disorders is necessary to identify the appropriate clinical diagnostic testing for risk stratification, to elucidate underlying genetic architecture and facilitate novel gene discovery, and to provide essential knowledge about genes and pathways impacting the development of laterality disorders.<br></p>",

These are among the most common causes of Infant mortality in the developed world and underlie nearly half of hospitalizations in the first 3 years of life. Of the 35 major defects observable at birth from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance Program (<a href=\"www.icbdsr.org\">www.icbdsr.org</a>, external link), about half involve the nervous system. Many of these result in lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders. Structural Brain Defects (SBDs) result from errors in development of the central nervous system, including defects in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Many SBDs arise as the consequence of a single gene bi-allelic mutation, and for this reason, occur more commonly in populations or communities with elevated consanguinity.</p>\n<p>Our lab has identified dozens of novel SBD genes using WES/WGS in consanguineous SBD families. Importantly, the genes that we and others have identified in these unique families are then used to advance diagnosis in pediatric SBDs around the world. We have built an enormous cohort of SBD families, including newly recruited families not yet studied genetically, and previous families that were negative for cause following WES analysis. Here we propose to collaborate with the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (X01) to have sequencing performed in individuals from a total of 200 families with genetically undiagnosed SBDs. The Gleeson Lab team of researchers is dedicated to the field of SBDs, with an outstanding track record of high-impact science, and a collaborative approach to discovery. We have 150 newly recruited families that we propose to study by WES by sequencing blood-derived DNA from two affected patients, or the parents and one affected patient. We also have 50 families in which WES was negative, which we propose to study in a multi-omics approach combining WGS from blood-derived DNA. We anticipate that this study will lead to the identification of many new molecular causes of SBDs, as well as uncover new genotype-phenotype correlations and new disease mechanisms, paving the way for future breakthroughs in detection, treatment and prevention.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Myelomeningocele (aka meningomyelocele, MM) is the most severe form of spina bifida, a neural tube defect (NTD) in humans and the most common CNS birth defect. MM is considered a genetically complex disease, and occurs in 3.72/10,000 live US birth, and is partly preventable with prenatal folate, but the genetic basis and the mechanisms by which folate work to reduce disease incidence remain obscure. MM is associated nearly uniformly with prenatal hydrocephalus and the Arnold-Chiari malformation, as well as paraplegia and lifelong neuromotor disability. The genes for several rare syndromic forms of NTDs are known, but the causes for the majority with sporadic MM remain unknown.</p>\n<p>Despite the importance of MM, most previous research has been limited to targeted sequencing and association studies of folate metabolism genes, or very small-scale exome sequencing. We hypothesize that de novo mutations (DNMs) produce likely gene disrupting (LGD) events that contribution to MM risk. Using conservative estimates of between 50-100 recurrently mutated discoverable genes contributing to risk, and our preliminary data demonstrating an excess of LGD DNMs in MM compared with control individuals, we estimate that with a cohort size of 1000 trios, we should uncover between 5-20 new recurrently mutated genes underlying MM, with minimal false-discovery. With this in mind, we formed the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium, and established a platform for data and sample sharing. Preliminary analysis of our first batch of 100 trios analyzed by WGS from GMKF suggests a wealth of important gene mutations. We have embarked on a new recruitment effort of an additional cohort of 400 new simplex MM trios, in collaboration with the US Spina Bifida Association, consented trios to allow for data sharing, and have performed detailed sample quality control. We also have preliminary data that use of dried bloodspot DNA from trios performs comparably to whole blood DNA, so will be happy to swap saliva for bloodspot recruitment at NIH’s preference. This cohort is now half-way assembled, with the remaining cohort to be ascertained in the next 6 months. We have established a workflow for de novo SNP/INDEL/SV detection from WGS and have ample computer storage and nodes to see the project to completion. We also plan to continue recruitment into the future with the goal of 2000 trios in the next 5 years. We propose a detailed bioinformatics workflow to identify gene mutations within a statistical framework, considering detailed scRNA expression profiling from developing mammalian neural tube, and have developed a robust functional validation workflow using Xenopus and mouse gene targeting. Our project has the potential to uncover a host of causes for this most common of the CNS birth defects, paving the way for future breakthroughs in detection, treatment, and prevention.</p>",

However, in addition to alcohol, other susceptibility factors, such as maternal or fetal genetic variation, must play a role as not all children prenatally exposed to alcohol are similarly affected. The proposed study will examine the role of genetic susceptibility for FASD. This work will help to inform more effective intervention efforts for this common congenital disorder.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are the most common craniofacial structural birth defect in humans caused by incomplete formation of the upper lip and/or the palate. Over 4,000 children in the Philippines are born with an OFC every year, and the Filipino OFC birth prevalence rate of 1 in 500 live births is one of the highest in the world. Genome-wide association studies support a multifactorial etiology for OFCs, but common variants only account for up to ~25% of the heritable risk in any one population. Sequencing studies in diverse populations is essential to fully understand the genetic architecture of OFCs. The study goals of the <a href=\"https://www.commonfund.nih.gov/KidsFirst\">Kids First</a> project are to sequence a collection of case-parent trios from the Philippines, in order to identify <em>de novo</em> mutations and inherited rare variants, and understand the population differences in common variant signals in the Philippines versus other populations. Approximately 373 trios from the Philippines were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS) as part of this <a href=\"https://www.commonfund.nih.gov/KidsFirst\">Gabriella Miller Kids First</a> project.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Chromosome abnormalities are a common cause of structural birth defects. Both childhood cancers and structural birth defects are critical and costly conditions associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the underlying genetic etiology of these diseases has the potential to profoundly improve preventative measures, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions.However, because these genomic copy number changes involve multiple genes and because most of these conditions are individually rare, defining the specific causative genes behind specific phenotypes has been a challenge. We met that challenge by spending the last 28 years enrolling and evaluating anyone with a chromosome 18 abnormality.</p>\n<p>The cohort now includes over 700 individuals with a wide variety of chromosome 18 copy number changes (CNV), as well as their parents. Because the vast majority of these participants have individually unique CNVs, we have been able to perform extensive genotype-phenotype correlations resulting in 58 publications. Of the 263 genes on chromosome 18, 28 are linked to specific hemizygous phenotypes. However, most have low penetrance. Genomic sequence data could identify variants in the extant allele that are hypermorphic and compensate for hemizygosity, or are hypomorphic and exacerbate hemizygosity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are phenotypes within this cohort that are rare, or an extreme version of one of the more common phenotypes. Genomic sequence data could help discover new biallelic conditions by revealing functional sequence variants of the extant allele. In both of these cases, there could also be variants in other genes on other chromosomes that may be associated with the phenotype that confer susceptibility or resilience. Inclusion of this unique cohort in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program can advance the goals of the program in several ways. First, by adding known susceptibility loci to the existing Kids First cohorts for the structural birth defects that are also found in our cohort. Second, for those structural birth defects known to be polygenetic, this cohort has a single defined risk factor which can simplify the search for secondary factors. Third, these studies can also bring clarity to people with chromosome 18 conditions and help to make the genotype more accurately predict phenotype. This approach could be a model for understanding the many other rare chromosome abnormalities which collectively are a common cause of structural birth defects.</p>",
