    "description": "<p>The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) has established a large biorepository of blood and urine (N=67,000) and cryopreserved lymphocytes (N=15,000) linked to extensive, prospectively collected risk factors (e.g., diet, smoking, physical activity), biomarkers and clinical data for five racial/ethnic groups. This cohort study of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and California is unique in that it is population-based and includes large representations of older adults (45-75 yrs at baseline) for five US racial/ethnic groups (Japanese Americans, African Americans, European Americans, Latinos and Native Hawaiians) at varying risks of chronic diseases. Within the PAGE investigation, the MEC proposes to study: 1) diseases for which we have DNA available for large numbers of cases and controls (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, diabetes, and obesity); 2) important cancers that are less common (e.g., lung, pancreas, endometrial cancers, NHL) but for which we propose to pool our data with other funded groups; 3) common traits that are risk factors for these diseases (e.g., body mass index/weight, waist-to-hip ratio, height) and 4) relevant disease-associated biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and lipids, steroid hormones). The specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids, steroid hormones); and 5) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies.</p>\n<p>This study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356\">phs000356</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The ARRA Autism Sequencing Collaboration was created in 2010 bringing together expert large-scale sequencing center (at the Baylor College of Medicine, PI Richard Gibbs and the Board Institute of MIT and Harvard, PI Mark J. Daly) and a collaborative network of research labs focused on the genetics of autism (brought together by the Autism Genome Project and the Autism Consortium). These groups worked together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture of autism through comprehensive examination of the exotic sequence of all genes. The Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) was founded by Joseph D. Buxbaum and colleagues as an international group of scientists who share autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples and genetic data. The PIs are Drs. Joseph D. Buxbaum (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Mark J. Daly (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), Bernie Devlin (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine), Kathryn Roeder (Carnegie Mellon University, Matthew State and Stephan Sanders (University of California, San Francisco). The rationale for the ASC is described in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259942\">Buxbaum et al. 2012</a>, and this paper should be cited when referencing the data set. All shared data and analysis is hosted at a single site, which enables joint analysis of large-scale data from many groups. The ASC was first supported by a cooperative agreement grant to four lead sites funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH100233, U01MH100209, U01MH100229, U01MH100239), with additional support from the National Human Genome Research Institute. The NIMH recently renewed their support with a second grant (U01MH111661, U01MH111660, U01MH111658 and U01MH111662) to expand the project from 29,000 genomes to more than 50,000 exomes over the next 5 years. NHGRI provides ongoing sequencing support for the ASD through the Broad Center for Common Disease Genomics (UM1HG008895, Mark Daly, PI).</p>",

GTEx will create a database that researchers can use to study how inherited changes in genes lead to common diseases.</p>\n<p>GTEx researchers are studying genes in different tissues obtained from many different people. The GTEx project also includes a study of the GTEx donor consent process - this study will help ensure that the consent process and other aspects of the project effectively address the concerns and expectations of participants in the study. GTEx is a pioneering project that uses state-of-the-art protocols for obtaining and storing a large range of organs and tissues, and for testing them in the lab. Until now, no project has analyzed genetic variation and expression in as many tissues from the same person in such a large population as planned for GTEx.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Description</strong></p>\n<p>Understanding the role of variation in the human genome is crucial to elucidating genetic contributions to human health and disease. Despite the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) documenting strong statistical associations between genetic variation and human traits, the functional role for most of these variants is largely unexplained. Nearly 90% of these GWAS-implicated sites lie outside of protein-coding sequences, suggesting that these variants might regulate gene expression.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is to establish a resource database and tissue biobank in which to study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression and other molecular phenotypes in reference/non-diseased tissues. The ultimate resource will include approximately 960 post-mortem donors with several dozen tissues from each, a resource large enough to study both <em>cis</em>- and <em>trans</em>- gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Some tissue will also be banked for additional molecular analyses. To request biosamples, please see the <a href=\"http://www.gtexportal.org/home/samplesPage\">Biobank page</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>GTEx was initially funded as a 2-year pilot project by the NIH Common Fund (CF) in 2010, and has been scaled up after demonstration of feasibility. The project will collect and analyze RNA levels in many different human tissues and each donor will be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping arrays and sequencing of either whole exomes or whole genomes.</p>\n<p>By treating RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, eQTLs will be identified as sites containing genetic variation that correlate with changes in RNA expression. Such eQTLs have been associated with 4%-12% of expressed human genes, and with common complex human diseases, including obesity, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Crohn's disease, and asthma. Additionally, few studies have examined the tissue specificity of eQTLs. A subset of banked tissue samples will also be analyzed for other molecular phenotypes, such as DNA methylation, DNaseI hypersensitivity sites, and proteomics. The GTEx project will thus serve as a resource database and tissue bank for many future studies, especially for understanding the functional basis of inherited susceptibility to disease.</p>\n<p>All GTEx releases since Version 5 follow the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy whereby there are no restrictions on use or publication after release. Additional information about the GTEx Data Release and Publication policy can be found on the GTEx Data Portal at <a href=\"http://www.gtexportal.org\">www.gtexportal.org</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>ClinSeq is a pilot project to investigate the use of whole-genome sequencing as a tool for clinical research. By piloting the acquisition of large amounts of DNA sequence data from individual human subjects, we are fostering the development of hypothesis-generating approaches for performing research in genomic medicine, including the exploration of issues related to the genetic architecture of disease, implementation of genomic technology, informed consent, disclosure of genetic information, and archiving, analyzing, and displaying sequence data. In the initial phase of ClinSeq, we are enrolling roughly 1000 participants; the evaluation of each includes obtaining a detailed family and medical history, as well as a clinical evaluation. The participants are being consented broadly for research on many traits and for whole-genome sequencing. Initially, Sanger-based sequencing of 300-400 genes thought to be relevant to atherosclerosis is being performed, with the resulting data analyzed for rare, high-penetrance variants associated with specific clinical traits. The participants are also being consented to allow the contact of family members for additional studies of sequence variants to explore their potential association with specific phenotypes. Here, we present the general considerations in designing ClinSeq, preliminary results based on the generation of an initial 826 Mb of sequence data, the findings for several genes that serve as positive controls for the project, and our views about the potential implications of ClinSeq. The early experiences with ClinSeq illustrate how large-scale medical sequencing can be a practical, productive, and critical component of research in genomic medicine.

    "description": "<p>The VIRGO study is a four year research project funded by the NHLBI to study young women and men with heart attacks. A total of 2,000 women who are 18 - 55 years of age and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 similarly aged men will be enrolled in this multi-site observational study from approximately 120 different hospitals across the country. Young women have a much greater risk of dying after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than similarly aged men. Their mortality risk is markedly higher than that of young men, and limited data on young minority women suggest that they may have the highest risk of any young subgroup. Findings from the small number of published studies of young women with ischemic heart disease suggest that the biology, epidemiology, care, and outcomes of this group are distinct from those of men. To date, there have been no large studies of this population, even as the death toll is comparable to that from breast cancer in this country. This study will help researchers identify key factors that influence recovery from a heart attack and potentially improve the care and outcomes of young women and men with AMI.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific Aims:</strong><br> To investigate the excess risk in young women with AMI and to identify key demographic, clinical, metabolic, psychosocial, health care delivery, and biological determinants of prognosis, we propose a national, prospective, observational study of 2,000 women who are 55 years or younger with AMI and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 men. Our prior work and preliminary studies indicate that the sex differences are most prominent in this age group and suggest that by 1 year after discharge, there are substantial sex differences in outcomes. We will also develop risk stratification tools that will help clinicians to identify young women with the highest and lowest risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Specific Aim 1:</strong> Determine sex differences in outcomes following AMI.<br> <strong>Specific Aim 2:</strong> Determine sex differences in the prevalence and prognostic importance of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors.<br> ** Specific Aim 3:**Determine sex differences in quality of care. <br> <strong>Specific Aim 4:</strong> Determine sex differences in the prevalence and prognostic importance of selected biochemical biomarkers following AMI.<br></p>\n<p><strong>These samples have been whole genome sequenced as part of the NHGRI's Center for Common Disease Genetics at the Broad Institute.</strong></p>",

The common genetic disorders proposed for study here are believed to have extreme locus heterogeneity, requiring the analysis of large numbers of samples to comprehensively identify the genomic variants underlying them. We propose that a combination of deep population studies and joint analysis of SNPs, indels, and structural variants both in coding and noncoding regions will provide the next level of understanding of common genetic disorders. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be critical to this next-generation approach to the genomics of complex disease. WGS will need to be accompanied by the technical ability to generate and handle very large data sets, a particular focus and strength of New York Genome Center (NYGC). WGS will also need to be accompanied by new statistical tools and algorithms, which will be developed by the strong core group committed to this proposal.</p>\n<p>An overarching goal of this proposal, one that capitalizes on the power of WGS, is to identify disease-associated variants at the individual nucleotide level. In many cases pathogenic mutations fall in noncoding regions of the genome, which can only be fruitfully explored with WGS. A major effort was put into building new computational strategies to functionally annotate noncoding transcribed sequences, and to build new datasets to enable such strategies, opening new frontiers of understanding of disease-related regulatory variants.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Methylation of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides is an epigenetic mechanism with essential roles in mammalian development. To explore its functions in cellular differentiation, unbiased analysis of CpG methylation by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has been used to characterize epigenetic differences among different human tissues and cell types. Meanwhile, human interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is not cell-type specific has attracted relatively little attention. Systemic interindividual epigenetic variation is important, however, because like genetic variation it is a potential determinant of phenotypic variation and can be assessed in any easily obtainable DNA sample. Since systemic epigenetic variants originate in the preimplantation embryo, their establishment can be influenced by periconceptional environment, and potentially provide information about lifetime risks relevant to global health, obesity, and cancer.</p>\n<p>We elucidated systemic interindividual variation in CpG methylation in the human genome. We studied brain, heart, and thyroid tissues (representing all three germ layer lineages) from each of 10 donors in the NIH Gene-Tissue Expression (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424\">GTEx</a>) project. We performed deep whole genome bisulfite sequencing for these 30 samples, achieving a sequencing depth of over 50x coverage per sample. We identified 9,926 correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIVs). These regions, comprising just 0.1% of the human genome, often correlate with one another over long genomic distances, are associated with transposable elements and subtelomeric regions, conserved across various human ethnic groups, and particularly sensitive to periconceptional environment. While genetic variation appears to influence methylation at most CoRSIVs, many show no evidence of genetic influence, suggestive of 'pure' epigenetic variation. At CoRSIVs, interindividual variation in DNA methylation in an easily biopsied tissue predicts expression in other tissues, and genes associated with these loci are implicated in a range of human disorders. In addition to charting a previously unrecognized molecular level of human individuality, this atlas of human CoRSIVs provides a resource for future population-based investigations into how interindividual epigenetic variation modulates risk of disease.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Modern genetic studies have been conducted predominantly in cohorts of individuals of European ancestry. By 2010, there were approximately ten times as many published genome wide association studies (GWAS) in people of European ancestry than studies in people of all other ancestries combined. This research disparity has led to an uneven understanding of the genetic basis underlying disease in Europeans and non-Europeans. 23andMe's web-based, large scale research model is ideal for scaling genetics research within non-European populations and thereby bringing more parity to genetics research. Our database is composed of genotypes and phenotypes of over 1,000,000 consenting customers, including over 200,000 individuals with non-European ancestry. The data derived from non-European individuals represent a particularly valuable resource for genetic discovery of novel variants that may not be found in the European population. However, research studies in non-European populations are weakened by the lack of availability of large-scale reference datasets and, in particular, genotype imputation panels. Genotype imputation is a statistical methodology that uses observations of genotypes in a large reference panel to infer unobserved genotypes in a target dataset. This methodology is widely used within GWAS, and allows novel genetic associations to be identified and refined. Due to this utility, very large reference panels have been constructed, containing thousands or tens of thousands of whole genome sequences. Unfortunately, the largest imputation panels are composed of predominantly European genomes, reflecting the modern bias towards European studies in GWAS. This proposal aims to address this imbalance by constructing an imputation panel specifically for the African American population. In doing so, we will expand 23andMe's ability to perform genetic discovery in non-European populations, and improve the understanding of global genetic variation underlying diseases and traits. Key commercial outcomes of the research include the identification of novel genetic targets for internal and external therapeutic development. The long-term aim is to improve understanding of disease in minority populations, which we hope may eventually lead to improved treatments of disease in these historically medically understudied groups.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Startup of Framingham Heart Study.</strong> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI) -- embarked on a novel and ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p>\n<p>The objective of the FHS was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Design of Framingham Heart Study.</strong> In 1948, the researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would later analyze for common patterns related to CVD development. Since 1948, the subjects have returned to the study every two years for an examination consisting of a detailed medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, and in 1971, the study enrolled a second-generation cohort -- 5,124 of the original participants' adult children and their spouses -- to participate in similar examinations. The second examination of the Offspring cohort occurred eight years after the first examination, and subsequent examinations have occurred approximately every four years thereafter. In April 2002 the Study entered a new phase: the enrollment of a third generation of participants, the grandchildren of the original cohort. The first examination of the Third Generation Study was completed in July 2005 and involved 4,095 participants. Thus, the FHS has evolved into a prospective, community-based, three generation family study. The FHS is a joint project of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Areas in the Framingham Heart Study.</strong> Over the years, careful monitoring of the FHS population has led to the identification of the major CVD risk factors -- high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical inactivity -- as well as a great deal of valuable information on the effects of related factors such as blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, age, gender, and psychosocial issues. Risk factors have been identified for the major components of CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, intermittent claudication, and heart failure. It is also clear from research in the FHS and other studies that substantial subclinical vascular disease occurs in the blood vessels, heart and brain that precedes clinical CVD. With recent advances in technology, the FHS has enhanced its research capabilities and capitalized on its inherent resources by the conduct of high resolution imaging to detect and quantify subclinical vascular disease in the major blood vessels, heart and brain. These studies have included ultrasound studies of the heart (echocardiography) and carotid arteries, computed tomography studies of the heart and aorta, and magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain, heart, and aorta. Although the Framingham cohort is primarily white, the importance of the major CVD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other studies to apply almost universally among racial and ethnic groups, even though the patterns of distribution may vary from group to group. In the past half century, the Study has produced approximately 1,200 articles in leading medical journals. The concept of CVD risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>In addition to research studies focused on risk factors, subclinical CVD and clinically apparent CVD, Framingham investigators have also collaborated with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects involving some of the major chronic illnesses in men and women, including dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutritional deficiencies, eye diseases, hearing disorders, and chronic obstructive lung diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>Genetic Research in the Framingham Heart Study.</strong> While pursuing the Study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators has expanded its research mission into the study of genetic factors underlying CVD and other disorders. Over the past two decades, DNA has been collected from blood samples and from immortalized cell lines obtained from Original Cohort participants, members of the Offspring Cohort and the Third Generation Cohort. Several large-scale genotyping projects have been conducted in the past decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis has been conducted using genotypes of approximately 400 microsatellite markers that have been completed in over 9,300 subjects in all three generations. Analyses using microsatellite markers completed in the original cohort and offspring cohorts have resulted in over 100 publications, including many publications from the Genetics Analysis Workshop 13. Several other recent collaborative projects have completed thousands of SNP genotypes for candidate gene regions in subsets of FHS subjects with available DNA. These projects include the Cardiogenomics Program of the NHLBI's Programs for Genomics Applications, the genotyping of ~3000 SNPs in inflammation genes, and the completion of a genome-wide scan of 100,000 SNPs using the Affymetrix 100K Genechip.</p>\n<p><strong>Framingham Cohort Phenotype Data.</strong> The phenotype database contains a vast array of phenotype information available in all three generations. These will include the quantitative measures of the major risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, and cigarette use, as well as anthropomorphic measures such as body mass index, biomarkers such as fibrinogen and CRP, and electrocardiography measures such as the QT interval. Many of these measures have been collected repeatedly in the original and offspring cohorts. Also included in the SHARe database will be an array of recently collected biomarkers, subclinical disease imaging measures, clinical CVD outcomes as well as an array of ancillary studies.

This project will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,000 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers, definite COPD cases (GOLD Stage 2 to 4), and subjects not included in either group (GOLD 1 or GOLD-Unclassified). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD-related phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of both cases and controls, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. <strong>The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease.</strong> The initial phase of genome-wide association analysis included 500 COPD cases and 500 control subjects (all non-Hispanic White) genotyped with the Illumina Omni-1 chip.

    "description": "<p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The original WHI study included 161,808 postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA serves as the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center for data collection, management, and analysis of the WHI.</p>\n<p>The WHI has two major parts: a partial factorial randomized Clinical Trial (CT) and an Observational Study (OS); both were conducted at 40 Clinical Centers nationwide.</p>\n<p>The CT enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:  - <strong>Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)</strong>: This double-blind component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component with an intact uterus were randomized to estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE], 0.625 mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 2.5 mg/d] or a matching placebo. Women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to CEE or placebo. Both trials were stopped early, in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively, based on adverse effects. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. - <strong>Dietary Modification Trial (DM)</strong>: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants were randomized to either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. - <strong>Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)</strong>: This double-blind component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component were randomized to calcium (1000 mg/d) and vitamin D (400 IU/d) supplements or a matching placebo.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Observational Study (OS)</strong> examines the relationship between lifestyle, environmental, medical and molecular risk factors and specific measures of health or disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women not participating in the CT. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed annually for 8 to 12 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Extension Studies</strong>: The original protocol allowed for follow-up until March 2005, after which participants were invited to enroll in the first WHI Extension Study for follow-up through 2010. Participants were invited again to participate in the second WHI Extension Study with continued follow up from 2010 to at least 2015. As of March 31, 2011 there were 93,122 women enrolled in the second extension.</p>\n<p>In Extension Study 2, the overall WHI study population was divided into two new subsamples, the Medical Records Cohort (MRC) and the Self-Report Cohort (SRC). The MRC consists of all former hormone trial participants and all African American and Hispanic participants from all study components. The SRC consists of the remaining participants. The extent of outcome information collected differs between the two cohorts, with more extensive outcomes information collection on the MRC.</p>\n<p>As part of Extension Study 2, selected older WHI participants were invited to participate in an In Person Visit (a.k.a., Long Life Study) at their homes during which additional blood samples were collected and various measurements were taken (such as blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, grip strength, etc.).</p>\n<p>In October 2015, Extension Study 2 was renewed with continued follow-up planned through October 2020, pending annual contract review and renewal.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>: The WHI website, <a href=\"https://www.whi.org/about/SitePages/About%20WHI.aspx\">https://www.whi.org/about/SitePages/About%20WHI.aspx</a> has much more information about the study.

MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.</p>\n<p>Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.</p>\n<p>In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by four examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>MESA Family</strong><br> The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the <strong>Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)</strong> and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping.</p>\n<p>The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.</p>\n<p><strong>MESA Air</strong><br> The general goal of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution ('MESA Air') is to prospectively examine the relation between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures (including PM<sub>2.5</sub> and the progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease in a multi-city, multi-ethnic cohort. MESA Air will also prospectively examine the relationship between an individual level assessment of long-term ambient air pollution exposures and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. MESA AIR is funded by a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the University of Washington and subcontracts from the UW to other participating institutions.</p>\n<p>MESA Air will assess if ambient air pollution is associated with changes over time in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial activation in a longitudinal data model, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and specific cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and diet). The study will similarly assess if the incidence of cardiovascular events is associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, using a proportional hazards model. The study includes refinement of statistical tools, and explores joint/independent effects of acute and long-term pollutant exposure in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>The MESA Air study is built on the foundation of the ongoing MESA study. The parent MESA Study cohort is located in six geographic areas ('Field Centers') that capture tremendous exposure heterogeneity, comparable to or greater than the variability in locations of prior U.S. cohort studies. In addition to the six Field Centers, the study involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound and air pollution data.</p>\n<p>The cohort for the MESA Air study currently includes 6226 subjects: 5479 enrolled in the parent MESA study; 257 recruited specifically for this study, and 490 recruited from the MESA Family study. The entire MESA Air cohort will be followed over a 10-year project period for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events.</p>\n<p>On two occasions over the ten-year study period, 3600 subjects from the MESA Air cohort, residing in nine locales, will undergo computed tomography scanning to assess presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC), and ultrasound of the carotid artery to determine intima-media thickness (IMT). We will also repeatedly assess plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and endothelial function in 720 subjects.</p>\n<p>MESA Air adds state-of-the-art air pollution exposure assessment information to the MESA cohort study, and introduces new subjects and outcome measures to achieve our aims. The study will assess long-term individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants for each subject using community-scale monitoring, outdoor spatial variation, subject proximity to pollution sources, pollutants' infiltration efficiency, and personal time-activity information. The exposure models will be validated using detailed monitoring in a subset of subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>The MESA Cohort is utilized in the following dbGaP substudies.</strong> To view genotypes, analysis, expression data, other molecular data, and derived variables collected in these substudies, please click on the following substudies below or in the \"Substudies\" section of this top-level study page phs000209 MESA Cohort.  - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000420\">phs000420</a> MESA SHARe - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000283\">phs000283</a> MESA CARe - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000403\">phs000403</a> MESA ESP Heart-GO</p>",

The four communities are Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; the northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. ARIC is designed to investigate the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis, the etiology of clinical atherosclerotic diseases, and variation in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race, gender, location, and date.</p>\n<p>ARIC includes two parts: the Cohort Component and the Community Surveillance Component. The Cohort Component began in 1987, and each ARIC field center randomly selected and recruited a cohort sample of approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 from a defined population in their community. A total of 15,792 participants received an extensive examination, including medical, social, and demographic data. These participants were examined with the baseline visit occurring in 1987-89, the second visit in 1990-92, the third visit in 1993-95, the fourth visit in 1996-98, the fifth visit in 2011-13, the sixth visit 2016-17 and the seventh visit 2018-19.

    "description": "<p>The Cleveland Family Study is the largest family-based study of sleep apnea world-wide, consisting of 2284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study was begun in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. NIH renewals provided expansion of the original cohort (including increased minority recruitment) and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. Index probands (n=275) were recruited from 3 area hospital sleep labs if they had a confirmed diagnosis of sleep apnea and at least 2 first-degree relatives available to be studied. In the first 5 years of the study, neighborhood control probands (n=87) with at least 2 living relatives available for study were selected at random from a list provided by the index family and also studied. All available first degree relatives and spouses of the case and control probands also were recruited. Second-degree relatives, including half-sibs, aunts, uncles and grandparents, were also included if they lived near the first degree relatives (cases or controls), or if the family had been found to have two or more relatives with sleep apnea. Blood was sampled and DNA isolated for participants seen in the last two exam cycles (n=1447). The sample, which is enriched with individuals with sleep apnea, also contains a high prevalence of individuals with sleep apnea-related traits, including: obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and HTN.</p>\n<p>Phenotyping data have been collected over 4 exam cycles, each occurring ~every 4 years. The last three exams targeted all subjects who had been studied at earlier exams, as well as new minority families and family members of previously studied probands who had been unavailable at prior exams. Data from one, two, three and four visits are available for 412, 630, 329 and 67, participants, respectively. In the first 3 exams, participants underwent overnight in-home sleep studies, allowing determination of the number and duration of hypopneas and apneas, sleep period, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels; anthropometry (weight, height, and waist, hip, and neck circumferences); resting blood pressure; spirometry; standardized questionnaire evaluation of symptoms, medications, sleep patterns, quality of life, daytime sleepiness measures and health history; venipuncture and measurement of total and HDL cholesterol. The 4th exam (2001-2006) was designed to collect more detailed measurements of sleep, metabolic and CVD phenotypes and included measurement of state-of-the-art polysomnography, with both collection of blood and measurement of blood pressure before and after sleep, and anthropometry, upper airway assessments, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, and ECG performed the morning after the sleep study.</p>\n<p>Data have been collected by trained research assistants or GCRC nurses following written Manuals of Procedures who were certified following standard approaches for each study procedure. Ongoing data quality, with assessment of within or between individual drift, has been monitored on an ongoing basis, using statistical techniques as well as regular re-certification procedures. Between and within scorer reliabilities for key sleep apnea indices have been excellent, with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) exceeding 0.92 for the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Sleep staging, assessed with epoch specific comparisons, also demonstrate excellent reliability for stage identification (kappas>0.82). There has been no evidence of significant time trends-between or within scorers- for the AHI variables. We also have evaluated the night-to-night variability of the AHI and other sleep variables in 91 subjects, with each measurement made 1-3 months apart. There is high night to night consistency for the AHI (ICC: 0.80), the arousal index (0.76), and the % sleep time in slow-wave sleep (0.73). We have demonstrated the comparability of the apnea estimates (AHI) determined from limited channel studies obtained at in-home settings with in full in-laboratory polysomnography. In addition to our published validation study, we more recently compared the AHI in 169 Cleveland Family Study participants undergoing both assessments (in-home and in-laboratory) within one week apart. These showed excellent levels of agreement (ICC=0.83), demonstrating the feasibility of examining data from either in-home or in-laboratory studies for apnea phenotyping. Data collected in the GCRC were obtained, when possible, with comparable, if not identical techniques, as were the same measures collected at prior exams performed in the participants' homes. To address the comparability of data collected over different exams, we calculated the crude age-adjusted correlations ~3 year within individual correlations between measures made in the most recent GCRC exam with measures made in a prior exam and demonstrated excellent levels of agreement for BMI (r=.91); waist circumference (0.91); FVC (0.88); and FEV1 (0.86). As expected due to higher biological and measurement variability, 149 somewhat lower 3-year correlations were demonstrated for SBP (0.56); Diastolic BP (0.48); AHI (0.62); and nocturnal oxygen desaturation (0.60).</p>\n<p><strong>NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.</strong> The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data will be created that includes records for approximately 50,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 1,200 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip will be conducted on approximately 9,500 African American participants drawn from the 50,000 participants in the nine cohorts.</p>\n<p><strong>Some relevant CARe publications</strong><br> CARe Study: PMID <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780\">20400780</a><br> CVD Chip Design: PMID <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833\">18974833</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a large, community-based, observational study whose participants were recruited from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Participants were enrolled from each of 4 recruitment pools: (1) random, 17%, (2) volunteer, 30%, (3) currently enrolled in the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/atherosclerosis-risk-communities-aric-study\">Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study</a>, 31%, and (4) secondary family members, 22%. The final cohort of 5,306 participants included 6.59% of all African American Jackson MSA residents, aged 35-84, during the baseline exam (N-76,426, US Census 2000). Among these, approximately 3,600 gave consent that allows genetic research and deposition of data into dbGaP. Major components of three clinic examinations (see study history) include medical history, physical examination, blood/urine analytes, and interview questions on areas such as physical activity, stress, coping and spirituality, racism and discrimination, socioeconomic position, and access to health care. Extensive clinical phenotyping includes anthropometrics, electrocardiography, carotid ultrasound, ankle-brachial blood pressure index, echocardiography, CT chest and abdomen for coronary and aortic calcification, liver fat, and subcutaneous and visceral fat measurements, and cardiac MRI. At 12-month intervals after the baseline clinic visit (Exam 1), participants have been contacted by telephone to update information, confirm vital statistics, document interim medical events, hospitalizations and functional status, and obtain additional sociocultural information. Questions about medical events, symptoms of cardiovascular disease and functional status are repeated annually. Ongoing cohort surveillance includes abstraction of medical records and death certificates for relevant <a href=\"https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases\">International Classification of Diseases (ICD)</a> codes and adjudication of nonfatal events and deaths.

We hypothesize that other genes within these four pathways or within other pathways also are VTE disease-susceptibility genes. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association (GWA) screen and analysis using the Illumina 660W platform to identify SNPs within 1,300 clinic-based, non-cancer VTE cases primarily from Minnesota and the upper Midwest USA, and 1300 clinic-based, unrelated controls frequency-matched on patient age, gender, myocardial infarction/stroke status and state of residence.</p>\n<p>This is a subset of a slightly larger candidate gene study using 1500 case-control pairs to identify haplotype-tagging SNPs (<strong>ht</strong>-SNPs) in a large set of candidate genes (n~750) within the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, and innate immunity pathways.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Populations.</strong><br> <strong><u>Cases</u>.</strong> VTE cases were consecutive Mayo Clinic outpatients with objectively-diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) residing in the upper Midwest and referred by Mayo Clinic physician to the Mayo Clinic Special Coagulation Laboratory for clinical diagnostic testing to evaluate for an acquired or inherited thrombophilia, or to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center. Any person contacted to be a control but discovered to have had a VTE was evaluated for inclusion as a case. Cases were primarily residents from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, North or South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana. A DVT or PE was categorized as objectively diagnosed when (a) confirmed by venography or pulmonary angiography, or pathology examination of thrombus removed at surgery, or (b) if at least one non-invasive test (compression duplex ultrasonography, lung scan, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging) was positive. A VTE was defined as:  - Proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which includes the common iliac, internal iliac, external iliac, common femoral, superficial [now termed \"femoral\"] femoral, deep femoral [sometimes referred to as \"profunda\" femoral] and/or popliteal veins. (Note: greater and lesser saphenous veins, or other superficial or perforator veins, were not included as proximal or distal leg DVT). - Distal leg DVT (or \"isolated calf DVT\"), which includes the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peroneal veins. (Note: gastrocnemius, soleal and/or sural [e.g., \"deep muscular veins\" of the calf] vein thrombosis was not included as distal leg DVT). - Arm DVT, which includes the axillary, subclavian and/or innominate (brachiocephalic) veins. (Note: jugular [internal or external], cephalic and brachial vein thrombosis was not included in \"arm DVT\"). - Hepatic, portal, splenic, superior or inferior mesenteric, and/or renal vein thrombosis. (Note: ovarian, testicular, peri-prostatic and/or pelvic vein thrombosis was not included). - Cerebral vein thrombosis (includes cerebral or dural sinus or vein, saggital sinus or vein, and/or transverse sinus or vein thrombosis). - Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis - Superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis - Pulmonary embolism</p>\n<p>Patients with VTE related to active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, a rheumatoid or other autoimmune disorder, a vascular anomaly (e.g., Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, etc.), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or a mechanical cause for DVT (e.g., arm DVT or SVC thrombosis related to a central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker, portal and/or splenic vein thrombosis related to liver cirrhosis, IVC thrombosis related to retroperitoneal fibrosis, etc.), with hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, or with prior liver or bone marrow transplantation were excluded.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Controls</u>.</strong> A Mayo Clinic outpatient control group was prospectively recruited for this study. Controls were frequency-matched on the age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years), sex, myocardial infarction/stroke status, and state of residence distribution of the cases. We selected clinic-based controls using a controls' database of persons undergoing general medical examinations in the Mayo Clinic Departments of General Internal Medicine or Primary Care Internal Medicine.

In addition to preventing the formation of the pressor angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors prevent the carboxyl-terminal degradation of the vasoactive substances bradykinin and substance P. Angioedema is hypothesized to result from defective amino-terminal degradation of bradykinin or substance P in patients in whom ACE is inhibited. For example, activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), the enzyme responsible for the inactivation of substance P when ACE is inhibited, is decreased in patients with angioedema. In preliminary studies, we have identified SNPs in the DPP4 gene that associate with DPP-IV activity and, in blacks, with risk of angioedema.</p>\n<p>This project will use genome-wide genotyping to compare 250 cases and 568 ACE inhibitor-exposed control subjects (131 cases and 288 controls ascertained at Vanderbilt and 70 cases and 280 controls ascertained at the Marshfield Clinic). We plan a 2-stage analysis of associations between SNPs and angioedema - first, we will study DPP4 SNPs for association with angioedema and, second, we will explore associations using the full GWAS data set. Depending on the platform, additional DPP4 SNPs will be used to fully tag common genetic variants in both African American and European American samples. Based on the HapMap data, there are 14 tagging SNPs in people of European descent and 34 in Yoruba (selection criteria MAF>0.05 and r2>0.8).</p>\n<p>Cases were defined as having ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema if they had had swelling of the lips, throat, tongue or face while taking an ACE inhibitor but had never had angioedema while not taking an ACE inhibitor. For simplicity, intestinal edema was excluded. Control subjects were treated for at least 6 months with an ACE inhibitor without angioedema. Because black Americans are known to be overrepresented among patients with ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, control subjects were prespecified to be 50% black American, 50% white American, and 50% female. At Vanderbilt, the medical history, including the history of angioedema, was confirmed by a research nurse or physician using a detailed case report form. Characteristics of Vanderbilt cases appear in the Table. At Marshfield, medical history will be confirmed by chart review. The Marshfield cohort is 98% white American and 57% female with a mean age of 47.2 years.</p>",

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) focusing on subjects with a history of atrial fibrillation. Rate control therapy for AF uses a range of drugs (beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis) to depress conduction through the AV node, thereby preventing rapid rates and minimizing symptoms. In large groups of patients, such as the Vanderbilt AF Registry (a clinical and genetic repository with over 1200 patients with ECG-confirmed AF) from which these study subjects were drawn, approximately 5% display failure of aggressive AV nodal-blocking therapy to control ventricular rate. In these patients, interruption of the AV node by ablation and pacemaker implantation are necessary for adequate rate control.</p>\n<p>Study cases were individuals who underwent AV node ablation and pacemaker implantation after combined therapy with 3 AV nodal-blocking agents was ineffective in rate control.

Most cases of SCID result from either X-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in a known causative gene. However, in some cases, the molecular etiology remains unclear. To identify the cause of SCID in a patient known to lack the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays and whole exome sequencing. The patient's mother was heterozygous for an inactivating mutation in <em>CD45</em>, while the paternal alleles lacked mutations. The patient exhibited a single <em>CD45</em> mutation identical to the maternal allele. Patient SNP array analysis revealed no change in copy number but loss of heterozygosity for the entire length of chromosome 1 (Chr1), indicating that disease was caused by uniparental disomy (UPD) with isodisomy of the entire maternal Chr1 bearing the <em>CD45</em> mutation. Non-lymphoid blood cells and other mesoderm and ectoderm-derived tissues retained UPD of the entire maternal Chr1 in this patient who had undergone successful bone marrow transplantation. Exome sequencing revealed mutations in 7 additional genes bearing nonsynonymous SNPs predicted to have deleterious effects. These findings represent the first reported case of SCID caused by UPD and suggest UPD should be considered in SCID and other recessive disorders, especially when the patient appears homozygous for an abnormal gene found in only one parent. Evaluation for alterations in other genes affected by UPD should also be considered in such cases.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a clinical condition more commonly observed in African-Americans. It is characterized by a relative reduction in neutrophil count by about 1000 cells per microliter, leading to a decrease in total leukocyte count by similar decrement. Previous reports of this condition showed that there was neither higher frequency nor increased severity of infections in affected individuals. Bone marrow examinations showed normal white cell maturation; and ex vivo culture of marrow cells showed low normal or slightly reduced number of myeloid colonies. Under physiologic stress, the increases in neutrophil and leukocyte counts of BEN individuals are slightly lower, compared to normal African-Americans or Caucasians. These clinical observations suggest that BEN results from a lower 'set point' for cell number in the marrow. Additionally, case reports of familial BEN, the persistence of BEN over many decades in the US, UK, and Africa, and the recent report of Duffy antigen and chemokine receptor (DARC) being associated with neutropenia, all suggest a strong genetic association to neutropenia/leukopenia. Our initial look into microarray analyses in a pilot trial of subjects showed that there were no significant differences in mRNA signals between BEN and normal subjects. Therefore, we are now proposing a larger study, utilizing Illumina Omni Express chips, to look for genetic associations. We have partnered with the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS), where nearly half of the cohort are African-Americans.

Monogenic hypercholesterolemia has a prevalence of approximately one in 500 individuals, making it one of the most common inherited disorders. To date, mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) ligand-binding domains of APOB and PCSK9 have been shown to cause hypercholesterolemia.

The CFS was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on genetic and non-genetic risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In brief, the CFS is a family-based study that enrolled a total of 2284 individuals from 361 families between 1990 and 2006. The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first degree relatives, spouses and available second degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4 year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in the participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. The GCRC exam (n=735 selected individuals) included more comprehensive phenotype data on a focused subsample of the larger cohort, to permit linking SDB phenotypes with cardio-metabolic phenotypes, with an interest in identifying genetic loci that are associated with these related phenotypes. In this last round of data collection, a subset of 735 individuals was selected based on expected genetic informativity by choosing pedigrees where siblings had extremes of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Participants underwent detailed phenotyping including laboratory polysomnography (PSG), ECG, spirometry, nasal and oral acoustic reflectometry, vigilance testing, and blood and urine collection before and after sleep and after an oral glucose tolerance test.

The OOA population of Lancaster County, PA immigrated to the Colonies from Western Europe in the early 1700's. There are now over 30,000 OOA individuals in the Lancaster area, nearly all of whom can trace their ancestry back 12-14 generations to approximately 700 founders. Investigators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have been studying the genetic determinants of cardiometabolic health in this population since 1993. To date, over 7,000 Amish adults have participated in one or more of our studies.</p>\n<p>Due to their ancestral history, the OOA may be enriched for rare variants that arose in the population from a single founder (or small number of founders) and propagated through genetic drift. Many of these variants have large effect sizes and identifying them can lead to new biological insights about health and disease. The parent study for this WGS project provides one (of multiple) examples. In our parent study, we identified through a genome-wide association analysis a haplotype that was highly enriched in the OOA that is associated with very high LDL-cholesterol levels. At the present time, the identity of the causative SNP - and even the implicated gene - is not known because the associated haplotype contains numerous genes, none of which are obvious lipid candidate genes. A major goal of the WGS that will be obtained through the NHLBI TOPMed Consortium will be to identify functional variants that underlie some of the large effect associations observed in this unique population.</p>",

The JHS is a large, community-based, observational study whose 5306 participants were recruited from among the non-institutionalized African-American adults from urban and rural areas of the three counties (Hinds, Madison, and Rankin) that make up the Jackson, MS, metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Jackson is the capital of Mississippi, the state with the largest percentage (36.3%) of African Americans in the United States.</p>\n<p>The JHS design included participants from the Jackson ARIC study who had originally been recruited through random selection from a drivers' license registry. Approximately six months before the JHS was to begin, an amendment to the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act was passed that changed the level of consent for public release of personal information from driver's license lists from an \"opt out\" to an \"opt in\" basis. The Mississippi Highway Patrol was no longer able to release a complete listing of all persons with driver's licenses or state identification cards, which prevented its use in the JHS. New JHS participants were chosen randomly from the Accudata America commercial listing, which provides householder name, address, zip code, phone number (if available), age group in decades, and family components. The Accudata list was deemed to provide the most complete count of households for individuals aged 55 years and older in the Jackson MSA. A structured volunteer sample was also included in which demographic cells for recruitment were designed to mirror the eligible population. Enrollment was opened to volunteers who met census-derived age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) eligibility criteria for the Jackson MSA.</p>\n<p>In addition, a family component was included in the JHS. The sampling frame for the family study was a participant in any one of the ARlC, random, or volunteer samples whose family size met eligibility requirements. Eligibility included having at least two full siblings and four first degree relatives (parents, siblings, children over the age of 21) who lived in the Jackson MSA and who were willing to participate in the study. No upper age limit was placed on the family sample. Known contact information was obtained during the baseline clinic examination from the index family member with a verbal pedigree format to identify name(s), age(s), address (es), and telephone number(s). Recruitment was limited to persons 35-84 years old except in the family cohort, where those 21 years old and above were eligible.

After replication of genomic regions and informative SNPs in those regions, we will determine sequences of the important genes, and determine the specific genetic variants in the sequenced genes that are associated with adiposity and related cardiometabolic conditions. We will also identify gene by environment interactions, focusing on dietary intake patterns and nutrients.</p>",

We focus on asthma because of its public health significance.</strong> Asthma affects 26 million U.S. children and adults, remains a major cause of morbidity (one-half million hospitalizations a year) and is the most common cause of school and work days lost. Asthma-related costs are estimated to be over $12.7 billion annually. The Asthma Probands for both the extended pedigrees and the trios utilized in this study were selected on the basis of a physician diagnosis of asthma; a history of recurrent asthma attacks or at least 2 respiratory symptoms; and either airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine or significant response to bronchodilator (Albuterol) administration. These criteria are identical to the criteria used in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP).</p>\n<p><strong>The three primary goals of this project are to: (1) identify common and rare genetic variants that determine asthma and its associated phenotypes (height, weight, IgE level, lung function, bronchodilator response, steroid treatment response) through whole genome sequencing (WGS); (2) perform novel family based association analysis of our WGS data to identify novel genes for asthma; and (3) integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data with our WGS data and determine the epistatic interactions present using systems genomics approaches.</strong> Identification of the molecular determinants of asthma remains an important priority in translational science. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in this regard, identifying at least 10 novel susceptibility genes for asthma. However, as with most complex traits, the variants identified by GWAS explain only a fraction of the estimated heritability of this disorder. <strong>Herein, we propose a novel family-based study design and state-of-the-art genome sequencing techniques to map a set of sequence variants for asthma and its associated phenotypes and assess the interrelationships of the identified genes and variants using systems genomics methods.</strong> We have assembled a team of investigators highly-skilled and expert in whole genome sequencing (Drs. Michael Cho and Benjamin Raby), genetic association analysis (Drs. Scott T. Weiss, Jessica Lasky-Su and Christoph Lange), integrative genomics (Drs. Raby, Kelan Tantisira, Augusto Litonjua and Dawn DeMeo), and systems genomics (Drs. Weiss, Amitabh Sharma, Lange and Raby) to address this important problem with both a novel study design and data set.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The causal mechanisms of common diseases and their therapies have been only marginally illuminated by genetic variants identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS) utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Platelet activation pathways reflecting hemostasis and thrombosis are the underlying substrate for many cardiovascular diseases and related acute events. To overcome GWAS limitations, genomic studies are needed that integrate molecular surrogates for platelet-related phenotypes assayed in cell-based models derived from individuals of known genotypes and phenotypes. In our GWAS study of native platelet aggregation phenotypes and aggregation in response to low dose aspirin in 2200 subjects (GeneSTAR, Genetic Study of Aspirin Responsiveness), important genome wide \"signals\" (p&#x3C;5x10-8) associated with native platelet aggregation and important \"signals\" associated with platelet responsiveness to aspirin were identified and replicated. Although we are currently performing functional genomics studies to elucidate our most promising findings in known genes (PEAR1, MET, PIKC3G), most \"signals\" occurred in intergenic regions or in introns. Mechanistic interpretation is limited by uncertainty as to which gene(s) are up- or down-regulated in the presence of most SNP modifications. In this 3 phase proposal, we will (1) create pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and then differentiate these stem cells into megakaryocytes (2) develop an efficient strategy to produce iPS and megakaryocytes using a novel pooling method, and (3) produce iPS and megakaryocytes from 250 subjects in GeneSTAR (European Americans and African Americans), selected based on specific hypotheses derived from GWAS signals in native and post aspirin platelet function; characterize genetic mRNA transcripts using a comprehensive Affymetrix array; measure protein expression for transcripts of interest using mass spectrometry; examine mRNA and protein expression patterns for each GWAS signal to determine the functional pathway(s) involved in native platelet phenotypes; and examine the functional genomics of variations in responsiveness to aspirin using our prior genotyped and phenotyped population. Precise information about the exact functional processes in megakaryocytes and platelets may lead to innovative and tailored approaches to risk assessment and novel therapeutic targets to prevent first and recurrent cardiovascular and related thrombotic events.</p>",

While previous linkage, admixture, candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWA) studies show statistically compelling effects, causal variants are still unknown and much of sarcoidosis heritability is yet to be explained. This \"missing\" heritability likely includes effects of both common (minor allele frequency (MAF)>5%) and rare variants (MAF&#x3C;5%), since, in AAs, the former are inadequately represented and the latter are completely unexplored by commercial genotyping arrays. These facts, coupled with the availability of next-generation sequencing compel us to perform an exhaustive search for genetic variants that form the basis of sarcoidosis. The data generated are certain to identify candidate causal variants, provide fundamental insight for functional studies and lead to important new hypotheses of inflammation resulting in new treatments in not only sarcoidosis but other inflammatory diseases as well.</p>",

For this dataset, the SAFHS appellation represents an amalgamation of the original SAFHS participants and an expansion that reexamined families previously recruited for the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (R01DK042273) and the San Antonio Family Gall Bladder Study (R01DK053889). Due to this substantial examination history, participants may have information from up to five visits. The clinical variables reported are coordinated with TOPMed and include major adverse cardiac events (MACE), T2D status and age at diagnosis, glycemic traits (fasting glucose and insulin), blood pressure, blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, calculated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). Additional phenotype data include the medication status at each visit, classified in four categories as any current use of diabetes, hypertension or lipid-lowering medications, and, for females, current use of female hormones. Anthropometric measurements include age, sex, height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference and derived ratios.

Study visits were performed at enrollment, three months, and every six months thereafter with spirometry, questionnaires, and other clinical evaluations. The ECLIPSE CT scans have been analyzed with the VIDA software for emphysema and airway phenotypes. ECLIPSE has provided key insights into the clinical epidemiology of COPD, including COPD exacerbations (Hurst, NEJM 2010; 363: 1128) and lung function decline in COPD (Vestbo, NEJM 2011; 365: 1184).

To achieve this, researchers from multiple institutions across the U.S. were awarded grants to derive iPSC lines from more than 1,500 individuals representing various conditions as well as healthy controls for use in functional genomic (\"disease in a dish\") research. This extensive panel includes a diverse set of age, gender, and ethnic backgrounds, and therefore will be an invaluable tool for evaluations across demographics. Further enhancing the utility of these cell lines are data sets such as phenotyping, GWAS, genome sequencing, gene expression and -omics analyses (e.g., lipidomic, proteomic, methylomic) that can be matched to the cell lines.

    "description": "<p>The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and the risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease or progression of the subclinical disease. MESA researchers study a diverse, population-based sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic, and 12 percent Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent.</p>\n<p>Comprehensive phenotypic and pedigree data for MESA study participants are available through dbGaP entry <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000209\">phs000209</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>MESA</strong></p>\n<p>Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles. Each participant received an extensive physical exam and determination of coronary calcification, ventricular mass and function, flow-mediated endothelial vasodilation, carotid intimal-medial wall thickness and presence of echogenic lucencies in the carotid artery, lower extremity vascular insufficiency, arterial wave forms, electrocardiographic (ECG) measures, standard coronary risk factors, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial factors. Selected repetition of subclinical disease measures and risk factors at follow-up visits allows study of the progression of disease. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes and possibly, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other genetic techniques. Participants are being followed for identification and characterization of cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure; for cardiovascular disease interventions; and for mortality.</p>\n<p>In addition to the six Field Centers, MESA involves a Coordinating Center, a Central Laboratory, and Central Reading Centers for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, and Electrocardiography (ECG). Protocol development, staff training, and pilot testing were performed in the first 18 months of the study. The first examination took place over two years, from July 2000 - July 2002. It was followed by five examination periods that were 17-20 months in length. Participants have been contacted every 9 to 12 months throughout the study to assess clinical morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>MESA Family</strong></p>\n<p>The general goal of the MESA Family Study, an ancillary study to MESA funded by a grant from NHLBI, is to apply modern genetic analysis and genotyping methodologies to delineate the genetic determinants of early atherosclerosis. This is being accomplished by utilizing all the current organizational structures of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Genetic Centers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>In the MESA Family Study, the goal is to locate and identify genes contributing to the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), by looking at the early changes of atherosclerosis within families (mainly siblings). 2128 individuals from 594 families, yielding 3,026 sibpairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans, were recruited by utilizing the existing framework of MESA. MESA Family studied siblings of index subjects from the MESA study and from new sibpair families (with the same demographic characteristics) and is determining the extent of genetic contribution to the variation in coronary calcium (obtained via CT Scan) and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in the two largest non-majority U.S. populations. In a small proportion of subjects, parents of MESA index subjects participating in MESA Family were studied but only to have blood drawn for genotyping.</p>\n<p>The MESA Family cohort was recruited from the six MESA Field Centers. MESA Family participants underwent the same examination as MESA participants during May 2004 - May 2007. DNA was extracted and lymphocytes immortalized for study of candidate genes, genome-wide linkage scanning, and analyzed for linkage with these subclinical cardiovascular traits. While linkage analysis is the primary approach being used, an additional aspect of the MESA Family Study takes advantage of the existing MESA study population for testing a variety of candidate genes for association with the same subclinical traits. Genotyping and data analysis will occur throughout the study.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The UMMS miRhythm Study is an ongoing study of adult patients undergoing an elective electrophysiology study or arrhythmia ablation procedure for a supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is a major clinical and public health problem that is related to atrial pathologic remodeling. Few tools are available to quantify the activity or extent of this remodeling, rendering it difficult to identify individuals at risk for AF. Previous studies have suggested an important role for miRNA in cardiovascular disease through gene expression regulation, making this a promising avenue for studying AF mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The aim of the study is to determine the time-dependent changes to key circulating miRNAs in a model of planned atrial injury and remodeling via ablation. Such knowledge might provide additional insight into the biology and activity of the acute atrial injury response, and furthermore, inform new targets for development of preventative interventions or allow for better AF risk stratification. To assess pathways regulating atrial pathological remodeling, patient blood samples are collected prior to their ablation procedures and also at a regularly scheduled 1-month follow-up appointment. Plasma expression of miRNA is measured using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), providing novel insights into the regulatory processes underlying AF, as well as acute atrial injury in vivo. Additionally, data collected from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is used to supplement miRNA analyses and further explore new relations between genes and abnormal heart rhythm.</p>",

The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and is most commonly caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene located on chromosome 11. Participants in this study include children with SCD treated with hydroxyurea to pharmacologically increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduce disease severity. Therefore, the primary phenotype of interest in this study is the change in HbF levels in response to hydroxyurea treatment. Genetic factors have been shown to influence inter-individual variation in drug response, and identification of novel genes and variants associated with clinical outcomes in SCD will be achieved through collaboration between Baylor College of Medicine, Augusta University, Columbia University Medical Center, Emory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Hemophilia is clinically categorized by coagulation factor activity levels and ranges in severity from mild (6% to 30%) to moderate (1-5%) to severe (&#x3C;1%). Many female \"carriers\" of hemophilia also have decreased factor activity and morbidity from bleeding. Hemophilia A and B are almost always caused by identifiable mutations in the F8 and F9 genes, respectively, and these mutations are found throughout the structural genes.

    "description": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is the primary cause of many hospital admissions, and is associated with significant secondary morbidity by increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The incidence of AF is on the rise, and it is projected that by the year 2050 more than 10 million patients will be affected by AF in the United States alone. Anti-arrhythmic medications have limited success in maintaining sinus rhythm, are associated with side effects, and appear ineffective at reducing mortality compared to a strategy of rate control and anticoagulation. Given the significant morbidity associated with this common arrhythmia, surgical and catheter ablation techniques have been developed to treat AF. However, despite the incorporation of various strategies for ablation, long-term recurrence rates of AF remain higher than 25 percent after ablation. Current techniques for catheter ablation of AF include pulmonary vein isolation and complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation. However, the contribution of each strategy to long-term procedural success and the relative importance of each strategy for different patients remain unknown. Recent advances in cardiac imaging have allowed detailed analysis of left atrial myocardial anatomy. Parallel advances in molecular genetics have identified several candidate genes involved in familial and non-familial AF. However, the pathophysiology of AF generation and maintenance, and the potential contribution of such genetic or anatomic substrates for patient selection, and for target identification during catheter ablation have not yet been examined. Advances in molecular genetics and imaging, coupled with techniques for endocardial and epicardial mapping in the electrophysiology laboratory present an opportunity to significantly improve our understanding of (1) The relation of paroxysmal versus persistent AF with (a) structural left atrial changes (left/right atrial scar, wall thinning, pulmonary vein anomalies, and coronary sinus dilation) and with (b) candidate genetic variants. (2) The relation of candidate genetic variants with (a) structural left atrial changes and with (b) electrophysiologic properties (atrial effective refractory period (AERP) inhomogeneity, voltage abnormalities, trigger burden and location, C FAE extent and location), (3) The relation of structural left atrial changes with (a) CFAE location as targets for catheter ablation and with (b) reversible conduction block/myocardial injury after pulmonary vein isolation, and (4) Individualized endocardial targets for AF ablation based on candidate genes and anatomic substrates. The proposed study will improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of AF, and may improve current techniques for treatment of this important arrhythmia.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by homozygosity for a single mutation of the beta hemoglobin gene. Despite the constancy of this genetic abnormality, the clinical course of patients with SCD is remarkably variable. SCD can affect the function and cause the failure of multiple organ systems through the pathophysiologic processes of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. These pathophysiological processes are complex and expected to impact multiple organ systems in a variety of ways. This study, therefore, was designed to identify genetic factors that predispose SCD patients to develop specific end-organ complications and to experience more or less severe clinical courses. We enrolled > 700 patients with Hb SS, Hb S-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia and HbSC being followed primarily at three southeastern U.S. regional institutions (Duke University Medical Center, University of North Carolina Medical Center, and Emory University Medical Center). Medical information obtained included the presence or absence of specific targeted outcomes (overall disease severity as well as specific types of end organ damage). Clinical data include medical status (history, physical, examination, and laboratory results) and information regarding potentially confounding environmental factors. Limited plasma samples are available for correlative studies (e.g. of cytokine levels, coagulation activation). Targeted SNP for candidate gene analysis as well as GWAS has been performed on most samples. Whole genome sequencing has been conducted through the TOPMed Consortium. The subjects in this analysis were collected as part of a larger study, \"Outcome Modifying Genes in Sickle Cell Disease\" (OMG-SCD) aimed at identifying genetic modifiers for sickle cell disease. More information about the study can be found in Elmariah et al. (2014), PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478166\">24478166</a>. Clinical and genetic data have been used to identify genetic characteristics predisposing patients with SCD to a more or less severe overall clinical course as well as to individual organ-specific complications. It is anticipated that identification of such genetic factors will reveal new therapeutic targets individualized to specific complications of SCD, leading to improved outcomes and increased life expectancy for patients with SCD.</p>",

Participants are enrolled through an opt-in process and consent to be followed throughout their clinical care (past, present, and future) in real-time, allowing us to integrate their genomic information with their EHRs for discovery research and clinical care implementation. BioMe participants consent for recall, based on their genotype and/or phenotype, permitting in-depth follow-up and functional studies for selected participants at any time. Phenotypic and genomic data are stored in a secure database and made available to investigators, contingent on approval by the BioMe Governing Board. BioMe uses a \"data-broker\" system to protect confidentiality.</p>\n<p>Ancestral diversity - BioMe participants represent a broad racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity with a distinct and population-specific disease burden. Specifically, BioMe participants are of African (AA), Hispanic/Latino (HL), European (EA) and other/mixed ancestry. BioMe participants are predominantly of African (AA, 24%), Hispanic/Latino (HL, 35%), European (EA, 32%), and other ancestry (OA, 10%). Participants who self-identify as Hispanic/Latino further report to be of Puerto Rican (39%), Dominican (23%), Central/South American (17%), Mexican (5%) or other Hispanic (16%) ancestry. More than 40% of European ancestry participants are genetically determined to be of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. With this broad ancestral diversity, BioMe is uniquely positioned to examine the impact of demographic and evolutionary forces that have shaped common disease risk.</p>\n<p>Phenotypes available in BioMe - BioMe has a high-quality and validated set of fully implemented clinical phenotype data that has been culled by a multi-disciplinary team of experienced investigators, clinicians, information technologists, data-managers, and programmers who apply advanced medical informatics and data mining tools to extract and harmonize EHRs. BioMe, as a cohort, offers a great versatility for designing nested case-control sample-sets, particularly for studying longitudinal traits and co-morbidity in disease burden.</p>\n<p>Biomedical and clinical outcomes: The BioMe Biobank is linked to Mount Sinai's system-wide Epic EHR, which captures a full spectrum of biomedical phenotypes, including clinical outcomes, covariate and exposure data from past, present and future health care encounters. As such, the BioMe Biobank has a longitudinal design as participants consent to make all of their EHR data from past (dating back as far as 2003), present and future inpatient or outpatient encounters available for research, without restriction. The median number of outpatient encounters is 21 per participant, reflecting predominant enrollment of participants with common chronic conditions from primary care facilities.</p>\n<p>Environmental data: The clinical and EHR information is complemented by detailed demographic and lifestyle information, including ancestry, residence history, country of origin, personal and familial medical history, education, socio-economic status, physical activity, smoking, dietary habits, alcohol intake, and body weight history, which is collected in a systematic manner by interview-based questionnaire at time of enrollment.</p>\n<p>The IPM BioMe Biobank contributed ~10,600 DNA samples for whole genome sequencing to the TOPMed program.

    "description": "<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome, with affected individuals demonstrating marked differences in lung structure (emphysema vs. airway disease); physiology (airflow obstruction); and other clinical features (e.g., exacerbations, co-morbid illnesses). Multiple genomic regions influencing COPD susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and rare coding variants can also influence risk for COPD. However, only a small percentage of the estimated heritability for COPD risk can be explained by known genetic loci. Like most complex diseases, COPD is influenced by multiple genetic determinants (each with modest individual effects). Emerging evidence supports the paradigm that complex disease genetic determinants are part of a network of interacting genes and proteins; perturbations of this network can increase disease risk. To identify this network, multiple Omics data will need to be analyzed with methods to account for nonlinear relationships and interactions between key genes and proteins. Our overall hypothesis is that integrated network analysis of genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic data from biospecimens ranging from lung tissue to nasal epithelial cells to blood in highly phenotyped subjects will provide insights into COPD pathogenesis and heterogeneity. We will leverage the well-phenotyped, NHLBI-funded Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) to address these questions. We will perform multi-omics analysis in 1548 lung tissue and blood samples from the LTRC. With these multi-omics data, we will utilize a systems biology approach to understand relationships between multiple genetic determinants and multiple types of Omics data. We will begin by performing single Omics analyses in COPD vs. control lung, nasal, and blood samples. Next, we will integrate single Omics data with genetic variants identified by WGS to assist in fine mapping genetic determinants of COPD. We will then perform integrated network analysis of COPD with genetic and multiple Omics data using correlation-based, gene regulatory, and Bayesian networks.

    "description": "<p>Myocardial ischemia occurs when there is a mismatch between coronary oxygen delivery and metabolic requirements of the myocardium, which may be clinically manifested during angina, coronary angioplasty or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Myocardial ischemia may lead to a spectrum of myocardial stunning, hibernating myocardium, and ultimately cell death if the ischemic insult is severe. In the human heart, irreversible damage begins after approximately 20 to 40 minutes of oxygen deprivation. Observed molecular and cellular changes of myocardial ischemia are characteristic of an inflammatory response, but the exact mechanisms that underlie this pathological process are unclear and may not be full emulated by animal models of ischemia or infarction. Thus, we felt it valuable to investigate a human ischemia model. During cardiac surgery, CPB with aortic cross-clamping (AoXC) and cardioplegic arrest is associated with excellent clinical outcomes and suitable operative conditions. However, despite the use of cardioprotective strategies, AoXc during CPB is accompanied by a variable, yet obligate ischemic period lasting 1 to 3 hours, resulting in hypoxia, metabolic substrate depletion, reperfusion injury, apoptosis, and necrosis. Cardiac specific biomarkers of ischemia and infarction, including troponin, are elevated even after routine coronary artery bypass graft surgery and correlate with the duration of ischemia from AoXc.</p>\n<p>This process of CPB provides us with the ability to examine the transcriptional profile before and after an expected, consistent, and reproducible human ischemic event, albeit induced by cold cardioplegic arrest and not coronary occlusion. In addition, the absence of reperfusion in this time period allows us to examine the transcriptomic response to intermittent ischemia, without having to account for the perturbations of reperfusion injury. Although various animal models have been used to examine the effects of ischemia on cardiac function, no human data exist which examine the early transcriptomic response to a left ventricular (LV) ischemic insult. We therefore characterized the effect of cold cardioplegia induced acute ischemia on the transcriptional profile of the LV by performing whole transcriptome next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery by sampling human LV tissue prior to, and after, the obligate ischemia during AoXC. We hypothesized that the cold cardioplegia induced ischemic injury will dramatically alter transcription in the human myocardium, and that we would identify genes and pathways, which will identify interventional targets for pharmacological therapy.</p>\n<p>Methods:</p>\n<p>We have collected left ventricle tissue samples and blood sample from patients undergoing heart surgery. We obtained punch biopsies (~3-5μg total RNA content) from the site of a routinely placed surgical vent in the anterolateral apical left ventricular wall of patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. After an average of 79 minutes of aortic cross-clamping with intermittent cold blood cardioplegia for myocardial protection every 20 minutes, a second biopsy was obtained in the same manner. Tissue samples were immediately placed in RNAlater® (Ambion, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and after 48 hours at +4°C were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were prepared by poly(A) mRNA isolation and reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 or HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). As samples were analyzed at different times, different read lengths were employed, initially using single-end reads (n=20) and then transitioning to paired end reads (n=216), ranging from 36 - 100 base pairs. Raw sequencing files were processed using Sickle, Skewer, and STAR software, and aligned to GrCh37 or UCSC Hg19.</p>\n<p>DNA was isolated from whole blood using standard methods. SNP genotyping was performed using the Illumina Omni2.5Exome-8 BeadChip array with additional exome content (Illumina, San Diego, CA) chip, version 1.1. We first phased and imputed 93 subjects using a phasing tool called SHAPEIT and an imputation tool called MINIMAC, with 1000 Genomes phase 1 version 3 for the reference panel. We then phased and imputed 26 more subjects using SHAPEIT, an imputation tool called IMPUTE2, and 1000 Genomes phase 3 version 5.</p>",

The PCGC has recruited and clinically characterized = 10,000 CHD probands and parents (CHD trios). From whole exome sequencing (WES) of >2800 CHD trios, we identified a substantial enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in genes important for cardiogenesis, particularly implicating histone modifier enzyme gene defects. Analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 350 probands with CHD unexplained by WES and their parents preliminarily implicated <em>de novo</em> mutations in enhancers of genes previously shown to cause CHD in mouse knock out models. Sequencing of RNA (RNAseq) from discarded cardiac tissues from CHD probands has revealed likely causal allele-specific expression (ASE) as well as biallelic loss of expression (LOE). We have also discovered de novo epimutations, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), some with underlying <em>de novo</em> DNA variation, that are detectable in peripheral blood leukocytes and appear to underlie 10% of CHD. Of note, these assorted 'omic' approaches have enabled one another, both for attributing causality and assessing functional impact. Based on these extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that PCGC probands with uninformative exomic analyses (WES-negative) harbor <em>de novo</em> genetic and/or epigenetic mutations in critical regulatory elements that participate in developmental expression of cardiac genes. To identify these etiologies, we propose analyses of WGS in 1000 WES-negative CHD trios, prioritizing those with probands with banked CHD tissues (n=78), one damaging variant in a recessive CHD gene, and older fathers (age>45). We also request WGS for 230 probands, for whom we have cardiac tissues but not parental DNAs. We request RNAseq for 308 cardiac tissues. For DNA methylation, which TOPMed will offer through the Illumina 850k array platform, we are requesting analysis of DNAs from peripheral blood leukocytes for all probands for whom WGS will be performed (1000 from trios, 230 singletons) as well as DNAs from cardiac tissues (n=308) to pair with the WGS, RNAseq and blood DNA methylation data. We will use existing resources and capabilities of the PCGC to confirm relevant mutations and those of its companion consortium in the Bench to Bassinet Program, the Cardiovascular Development Consortium, to inform analyses of non-coding mutations as well as to perform confirmatory functional genomics studies using cell and animal models. We expect that the studies resulting from data generated through TOPMed will provide novel insights into the molecular basis for CHD and fundamental knowledge about genes and pathways involved in cardiac development. Aside from being relevant to CHD, we anticipate that our findings will inform the understanding of later-onset cardiovascular diseases, including some arising in adulthood.</p>",

While Mendelian cardiovascular disorders are individually rare, collectively they impose a significant public health burden. This proposal focuses on 2 specific categories of cardiovascular disease for which we have extensive research expertise and existing cohorts, congenital heart disease (CHD) and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The tremendous burden on the health care system and on families with these Mendelian cardiovascular disorders underscore the urgency to understand their genomic bases, in order to design improved strategies for risk stratification, surveillance and medical intervention. Emerging evidence supports the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) over whole-exome sequencing (WES) for detecting coding variants in discovery projects, in addition to the obvious advantages of detecting features invisible to WES: structural variants (SV) and non-coding variants. We believe the way forward lies in widening the scope for discovery to include the patient's entire genome - and all types of variants. While family-based studies are crucial for genomic discovery, obtaining a sufficient number of high-risk pedigrees to achieve meaningful conclusions remains a challenge for most research institutions. For this proposal, we will leverage 2 powerful resources for the identification, ascertainment and recruitment of high-risk cardiovascular disease pedigrees: (1) the NHLBI-sponsored Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) and (2) the Utah Population Database (UPDB). We propose to perform WGS on PCGC and UPDB cohorts with autosomal dominant disease to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the genomic basis for CHD in high-risk pedigrees derived from the PCGC and UPDB; and Aim 2) Identify the genomic basis for inherited arrhythmia disorders, using extended pedigrees derived from the UPDB. Aim 2 focuses on familial forms of AF, undiagnosed Long QT Syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome and progressive conduction disorders.</p>\n<p>A WGS approach in high-risk pedigrees coupled with our validated bioinformatics pipeline, will allow the identification and prioritization of disease-causing SVs and sequence variants in coding and non-coding regulatory elements. These variants will be functionally characterized and validated in downstream experiments (heterologous expression systems, zebrafish cardiac assays, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) that are beyond the scope of this X01. For this proposal, we have assembled the right combination of clinical expertise, resources for patient recruitment and computational know-how to enable these game-changing methodologies and to apply them to the challenge of cardiovascular Mendelian disease-gene discovery.</p>",

It is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and is coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Molecular fingerprinting and extensive subject phenotyping will be performed to identify disease subpopulations and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity, which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for future clinical trials. Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data in studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.</p>\n<p><strong>Participating Institutions:</strong></p>\n<p>Research participants for SPIROMICS will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at twelve SPIROMICS Clinical Centers: Columbia University, Temple University, Johns Hopkins University, Wake Forest University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Iowa, University of Utah, National Jewish Health, University of California at San Francisco, and University of California at Los Angeles. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill serves as the Genomics and Informatics Center. The Radiology Reading Center is based at the University of Iowa. The PFT Reading Center is based at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>\n<p><strong>Study Design:</strong></p>\n<p>SPIROMICS is a prospective cohort study that enrolled approximately 2,981 participants at twelve clinical centers over five years. Participants are distributed across four enrollment strata (i.e., Never-smokers, Smokers without COPD, Mild/Moderate COPD, and Severe COPD).</p>\n<p><strong>Study Visits:</strong></p>\n<p>Participants have up to four in-person visits (Baseline and Annual Clinic Visits at years 1, 2, 3 after Baseline). Study questionnaires and spirometry are completed at all main study visits. Blood and urine samples are collected at visits 1, 2, and 4. Sputum samples are collected at Visit 1. The CT scans are completed and Baseline and Visit 2. Participants also receive quarterly follow-up calls to assess health status and determine if an exacerbation has occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Substudies</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bronchoscopy and Immunophenotyping Substudy The Bronchoscopy Substudy will enroll 50 subjects per site, for a total of 300 participants. These participants will be recruited across all four study strata. This substudy includes two study visits. During the first visit, sputum samples are collected for Immunophenotyping analysis at the Immunophenotyping Core Lab based at the University of Michigan. Participants then return for a second visit during which samples are collected via bronchoscopy, including bronchoalveolar lavage, epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies. Immunophenotyping analysis is also conducted on BAL and blood collected during the bronchoscopy study visit. - Repeatability Substudy The entire baseline clinic visit was repeated on 98 volunteers to determine reliability of measurement procedures. All baseline study-related procedures and questionnaires, including the CT scan, were re-administered and new samples of blood, urine, saliva, and sputum were collected. Field center staff processed these biospecimen samples according to the same protocol. - Exacerbation Substudy The Exacerbation Substudy is a prospective, longitudinal observational study of up to 400 participants, which will allow the assessment of participant-driven health care utilization (HCU) events and symptom-defined exacerbation events over time. HCU-driven events are defined by change in medical treatment in response to a perceived COPD Exacerbation. Symptom-based events will be defined by using EXACT-PRO (EXacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool - Patient Reported Outcome), a daily symptom diary developed to measure the frequency, severity, and duration of exacerbations in clinical trials. All participants are provided with a PDA on which to complete the diary. Participants reporting a possible COPD exacerbation will be brought into the study clinic for a study visit to collect biological specimens and questionnaire data.\n<u>The overall objectives of the Exacerbation Substudy are to</u>:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain clinical data and specimens on SPIROMICS participants before and during an acute COPD exacerbation defined by <ol type=\"a\"> <li>Health care utilization triggered by the subject, or 1.

It is a common complication of sickle cell disease and initially presents with the symptom of shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion. As the condition worsens, other symptoms such as dizziness, lower extremity edema, and chest pain can develop. The drug, sildenafil, works by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs which reduces pulmonary blood pressure and allows more oxygenated blood to circulate. Increased levels of oxygenated blood allows individuals with PAH to tolerate more activity, but guidelines for using sildenafil in patients with PAH and sickle cell disease were unavailable at the time of the Walk-PHaSST trial.</p>\n<p>Participants were screened for the existence of pulmonary hypertension with a six minute walk test and a Doppler echocardiogram that assessed TRV, diastolic function, and valvular and systolic function. Subjects with TRV ≥ 2.7 m/s received further clinical evaluation for possible causes of pulmonary hypertension. Other screening data included medical history, a physical exam, and standard laboratory testing. For individuals with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (TRV ≥ 3.0), a cardiac catheterization was done at the baseline and week 16 data collection periods.</p>\n<p>Subjects eligible for the main intervention trial based on screening results were randomized in a 1:1 double blind fashion to receive sildenafil or placebo for 16 weeks. Subjects received 20 mg of oral sildenafil or matching placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks, followed by 80 mg 3 times daily for 6 weeks, as tolerated. Participants could also receive other therapies as needed to manage sickle cell and related complications. The primary outcome measure of the trial was change in the six minute walk test, a standard indicator of a person's heart and lung function and exercise capacity, from baseline to week 16. After completing the study treatment (or placebo), participants could choose to be part of the open-label follow-up phase of the study and continue to be assessed for up to one year.</p>\n<p>The study was intended to screen about 1000 subjects and randomize 132 subjects, however it was terminated early due to the unforeseen increase in adverse events in participants treated with sildenafil as compared to placebo.

Transplantation strategies have also evolved over time that has included transplant conditioning regimens of varying intensity, grafts other than bone marrow and novel approaches to overcome the donor-recipient histocompatibility barrier and limit graft-versus-host disease. The data that is available for sickle cell disease transplants have been utilized to report on outcomes after transplantation and compare outcomes after transplantation of grafts HLA-matched related, HLA-mismatched related, HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors.

    "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/datasets/cfs\">Cleveland Family Study (CFS)</a> is a family-based study of sleep apnea, consisting of 2,284 individuals (46% African American) from 361 families studied on up to 4 occasions over a period of 16 years. The study began in 1990 with the initial aims of quantifying the familial aggregation of sleep apnea. National Institutes of Health (NIH) renewals provided expansion of the original cohort, including increased minority recruitment, and longitudinal follow-up, with the last exam occurring in February 2006. The <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/datasets/cfs\">CFS</a> was designed to provide fundamental epidemiological data on risk factors for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The sample was selected by identifying affected probands who had laboratory diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. All first-degree relatives, spouses and available second-degree relatives of affected probands were studied. In addition, during the first 5 study years, neighborhood control families were identified through a neighborhood proband, and his/her spouses and first-degree relatives. Each exam, occurring at approximately 4-year intervals, included new enrollment as well as follow up exams for previously enrolled subjects. For the first three visits, data, including an overnight sleep study, were collected in participants' homes while the last visit occurred in a general clinical research center (GCRC). Phenotypic characterization of the entire cohort included overnight sleep apnea studies, blood pressure, spirometry, anthropometry and questionnaires. Currently, data of 710 individuals are available for use through <a href=\"https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/\">BioData Catalyst</a> (with genotype data available through <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/\">dbGaP</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/\">National Sleep Research Resource</a> (NSRR) is a NIH-supported sleep data repository that offers free access to large collections of de-identified physiological signals and related clinical data from a large range of cohort studies, clinical trials and other data sources from children and adults, including healthy individuals from the community and individuals with known sleep or other health disorders.  The goals of <a href=\"https://sleepdata.org/\">NSRR</a> are to facilitate rigorous research that requires access to large or more diverse data sets, including raw physiological signals, to promote a better understanding of risk factors for sleep and circadian disorders and/or the impact of sleep disturbances on health-related outcomes.  Data from over 15 data sources and more than 40,000 individual sleep studies, many linked to dozens if not hundreds of clinical data elements, are available (as of Feb. 2022). Query tools are available to identify variables of interest, and their meta-data and provenance.</p>",

By design, Black adults and residents of the deep south were oversampled. Between 2003 and 2007 (baseline visit) participants completed a computer-assisted telephone interview to collect demographic information and medication adherence, and an in-home visit for blood pressure measurements and collection of blood and urine samples. Following the baseline visit, participants have been contacted by phone at six-month intervals to obtain information on incident stroke or secondary outcomes. Additionally, samples and data were collected on about 50% of the original cohort during a second study visit an average of 10 years after the baseline visit.

For this reason, it may be hard to reach some patients and their families. Waiver of consent will be obtained after three attempts have been made to locate the patient and family without success, as well as for the rare child who dies before informed consent can be obtained. We will include a HIPAA-compliant cryptographic algorithm to create a sharable “hashed” identifier from patient information. If blood work for research purposes is added to usual clinically-indicated blood work during follow-up visits, this will be covered by other informed consent forms.

Heavily transfused patients frequently develop human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allo-immunization resulting in platelet transfusion refractoriness and a high risk for life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Data suggest complement activation leading to the destruction of platelets bound by HLA allo-antibodies may play a pathophysiologic role in platelet refractoriness. We conducted a pilot trial to investigate the use of eculizumab to treat platelet transfusion refractoriness in allo-immunized patients with severe thrombocytopenia. We hypothesized that when we treated patients having platelet refractoriness with eculizumab, platelet counts would increase to higher numbers after platelet transfusions, decreasing the risk of bleeding complications associated with having a low platelet count. The response of the treatment was assessed by the corrected platelet count increment (CCI) 10 - 60 min and 18 - 24 h post transfusion, and any requirement for subsequent platelet transfusions following eculizumab.

This has led to widespread efforts to characterize the epidemiologic characteristics of such post-COVID-19 sequelae. However, accurate data were limited, hindering the ability to counsel patients, caregivers, and policy makers and to plan relevant recovery-focused clinical research. Thus, the BLUE CORAL study was intended to address the knowledge gaps and provide critical data to help guide clinical care, public health, and scientific efforts.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Participants</strong></u>: A total of 1376 COVID-19 patents were enrolled, with 825 (444 male, and 379 female) that completed at least one follow-up survey.</p>\n<p>A subset of the BLUE CORAL adult participants were enrolled in the extension study, <a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_fire_coral/\">FIRE CORAL</a>.

Participants were enrolled between August 24, 2020, and July 20, 2021, with follow-up occurring through March 30, 2022. Posthospital surveys were administered by trained interviewers in English or Spanish to patients or their proxies at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were assessed using the Airways Questionnaire 20, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Fatigue was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Disability was assessed by self-report of limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Financial problems were assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 question and questions regarding job changes, time off work, and insurance coverage developed with the Mi-COVID-19 study using qualitative interviews. Quality of life was measured using the European Quality of Life 5-dimension 5-level instrument.</p>\n<p>The primary outcomes were new or worsened cardiopulmonary symptoms, financial problems, functional impairments, perceived return to baseline health, and quality of life.

    "description": "<p><u>Objectives</u><br>The primary objective is to determine event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year after unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) using bone marrow (BM) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).</p>\n<p><u>Background</u><br>Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is an inherited blood disease that can cause organ damage, stroke, and intense pain episodes. Children with sickle cell disease experience organ damage, impaired quality of life, and premature mortality. A blood stem cell transplant is a treatment option for someone with a severe form of the disease. Prior to undergoing a transplant, people typically receive a conditioning regimen of high doses of chemotherapy and other medications to prepare the body to accept the transplant. This type of conditioning regimen is known as a myeloablative conditioning regimen, but it can result in toxicities and sterility. A conditioning regimen that uses lower doses of chemotherapy and medications may be safer for transplant recipients. This type of regimen is known as reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. RIC has a more favorable toxicity profile but is associated with higher rates of graft rejection (GR), especially with graft sources such as umbilical cord blood This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of blood stem cell transplants, using bone marrow from unrelated donors, in children with severe SCD who receive a RIC regimen prior to the transplant.</p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>Patients 3.0-19.75 years old with symptomatic SCD AND one or more of the following complications: (1)-(i) a clinically significant neurologic event (stroke) or any neurologic defect lasting > 24 hours and accompanied by an infarct on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); OR, (ii) patients who have a Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity that exceeds 200 cm/sec by the non-imaging technique (or TCD measurement of >185 cm/sec by the imaging technique) measured at a minimum of 2 separate occasions one month or more apart; OR, (2) Minimum of two episodes of acute chest syndrome within the preceding 2-year period defined as new pulmonary alveolar consolidation involving at least one complete lung segment (associated with acute symptoms including fever, chest pain, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, or cough that is not attributed to asthma or bronchiolitis) despite adequate supportive care measures; OR, (3) History of 3 or more severe pain events (defined as new onset of pain that lasts for at least 2 hours for which there is no other explanation) per year in the 2 years prior to enrollment despite adequate supportive care measures (if patients are receiving hydroxyurea and compliant with therapy, being symptomatic is an indication for transplantation; however, if patients decline hydroxyurea or non-compliant with this therapy, they would still remain eligible for study if pain criteria as described above are met). Lansky/Karnofsky performance score must be ≥ 40. Hemoglobin S must be ≤ 45%. Patients must have an unrelated adult bone marrow donor who is HLA-matched at 8 of 8 HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 at high resolution using DNA-based typing. Patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver, with uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection in the past month, or seropositivity for HIV are excluded. Patients with HLA-matched family donors, or who have received prior HCT, and females who are pregnant or breast feeding are excluded. Thirty patients were enrolled on this study and of these, 29 patients met the criteria and proceeded to the study transplant.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>Participants attended a study visit prior to the transplant to undergo a blood collection, neurocognitive testing to measure learning and brain function, magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Questionnaires to assess quality of life were also completed. All patients received erythrocyte transfusions before transplant. Twenty-two days (-22) before the transplant, participants began receiving a reduced intensity conditioning regimen of chemotherapy and medications. On days -21, -20, and -19 participants weighing 10 kg or more received 10 mg, 15 mg, and then 20 mg of Alemtuzumab intravenously (IV) followed by 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day IV on days -8 through -4 of Fludarabine. Eight days (-8) before the transplant, participants were admitted to the hospital to continue the conditioning regimen which included 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV of Melphalan on day -3. Participants received the bone marrow transplant on day 0. Prophylaxis for GVHD consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) administered from day -3 through day 100 after graft infusion, with subsequent taper through day 180; methotrexate 7.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 3, and 6; and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg per day from days 7 through 28, with subsequent taper by 20% per week. One week after the transplant continuing until the WBC is normal, participants received granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After leaving the hospital, participants attended study visits weekly during weeks 1 to 8, at day 60, weekly during weeks 9 to 14, at Day 100, at month 6, and at years 1 and 2. At all study visits, a blood collection, medical history review, and physical exam occurred. In addition, at day 100, month 6, and years 1 and 2, questionnaires to assess quality of life were completed. At select visits the following procedures were conducted: lung function testing, heart function testing, MRA and MRI scans, and neurocognitive testing.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was 1-year EFS. Death, disease recurrence or graft rejection by 1 year were considered events for this endpoint.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>The trial met its prespecified 1-year EFS, and significantly improved HRQL was reported posttransplant. However, although the Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) provided successful engraftment in most patients, the regimen cannot be considered safe for widespread adoption without modification due to the regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and high rate of chronic GVHD, which was the predominant cause of mortality.<br></p>",

Further, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension in adults over 50 years of age. Observational studies have shown a monotonic increase in cardiovascular risk with systolic blood pressures above 115 mm Hg; however, general population clinical trials have only documented the benefits of lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 150 mm Hg. A 2007 expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designated the hypothesis that lowering the systolic blood pressure goal to a level &#x3C;120 mm Hg as the most important hypothesis to test in reducing hypertension related complications in those without diabetes.</p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>A total of 9361 participants were enrolled, with 4,678 randomized to the intensive-treatment group and 4,683 randomized to the standard-treatment group.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>SPRINT was a randomized, single blinded (outcome adjudicators were blinded to treatment assignment) treatment trial with participants randomized to a systolic blood-pressure target of either less than 140 mm Hg (the standard-treatment group) or less than 120 mm Hg (the intensive-treatment group). Following randomization, baseline hypertensive regimens were adjusted in accordance with study treatment algorithms established for each group. The study formulary included all major classes of antihypertensive agents. Investigators could prescribe other antihypertensive medications, but the use of drug classes with the strongest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes was encouraged. This included thiazide-type diuretics as the first-line agent, loop diuretics for participants with advanced chronic kidney disease, and beta-adrenergic blockers for participants with coronary artery disease. Medications for participants in the intensive-treatment group were adjusted on a monthly basis to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. Medications for participants in the standard-treatment group were adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 139 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced if systolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg on a single visit or less than 135 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Lifestyle modification was encouraged as part of the management strategy.</p>\n<p>Participants were seen monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. A structured interview was used in both groups every 3 months to obtain self-reported cardiovascular disease outcomes. Medical records and electrocardiograms were obtained for documentation of events. Incidences of hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and bradycardia that were evaluated in an emergency department were included in adverse event reporting. Occurrences of acute kidney injury or acute renal failure requiring hospitalization were also monitored. <br>The primary outcome was a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>The blood pressure intervention was stopped in August of 2015 (median follow-up of 3.26 years) after the cardiovascular outcome results exceeded the boundary for efficacy at two consecutive time points. Compared with a systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm Hg, an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause. Significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.</p>",

Evidence from previous clinical trials supports the use of coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) to relieve disabling symptoms of angina, particularly among high-risk subgroups with extensive CAD. However, the studies did not include patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, and developments in medical therapy have since led to updated guidelines. In addition, the benefits of CABG in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy had still not been clearly established at the time of this study. STICH sought to evaluate the role of CABG in the treatment of patients with CAD and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.<br></p>\n<p>Reduced left ventricular function may occur after myocardial infarction, often in conjunction with left ventricular remodeling, including left ventricular enlargement and changes in chamber geometry. Left ventricular remodeling is correlated with progression of heart failure and a poor prognosis. Therefore, a surgical approach to remodeling through left ventricular volume reduction could improve outcomes for patients with CAD and heart failure. Surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) has been shown to reduce the left ventricular volume, increase the ejection fraction, and improve ventricular function. There is also evidence that SVR performed with CABG may reduce the rate of hospitalization and improve ventricular function, as compared to CABG alone. As part of a second hypothesis, STICH additionally investigated whether SVR when added to CABG would improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and CAD.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 2,136 participants were enrolled in STICH. 1,212 were enrolled in the hypothesis 1 component of the trial, with 602 participants assigned to receive medical therapy alone, and 610 participants assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG. 1,000 were enrolled in the hypothesis 2 component, with 499 participants assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG, and 501 participants assigned to receive medical therapy plus CABG and SVR. 76 participants that were assigned to the CABG with medical therapy treatment were enrolled in both hypothesis components.<br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>After initial determination of overall eligibility, participants were evaluated to determine which component of the STICH program was appropriate for them on the basis of suitable therapeutic options. All participants underwent cardiac imaging for assessment of left ventricular function and wall motion. Participants in the hypothesis 1 component were randomly assigned to receive either medical therapy alone or medical therapy plus CABG. Participants in the hypothesis 2 component were randomly assigned to receive either medical therapy plus CABG or medical therapy plus CABG and SVR.<br></p>\n<p>At baseline, demographic factors and clinical characteristics were assessed, including current medications and prior diagnostic and other cardiovascular procedures, and a physical examination was performed. Guideline-based recommendations for drug and device use were emphasized for all participants. All participants underwent follow-up evaluations at the time of discharge or at 30 days for participants still hospitalized, every 4 months for the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. The median length of follow-up was 56 months for hypothesis 1 and 48 months for hypothesis 2.<br></p>\n<p>For participants receiving CABG, arterial grafting for stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery was required for all participants without specific contraindications. The use of additional arterial conduits supplemented by vein grafts was recommended for revascularization of all major vessels with clinically significant stenoses. Concurrent mitral-valve surgery for regurgitation was performed at the discretion of the surgeon. For participants receiving SVR, the operation was most commonly performed during a single period of cardioplegic arrest after construction of bypass grafts. However, the procedure could also be performed with the heart beating in order to facilitate identification of the noncontractile zone of scarring. After an anterior left ventriculotomy was centered in the zone of anterior asynergy, a suture was placed in the interior of the ventricle to encircle the scar at the boundary between the akinetic and viable tissue. Visual inspection and palpation facilitated the judgment of whether a patch was needed to optimize the chamber size without deforming the left ventricle during closure of the ventriculotomy.<br></p>\n<p>The primary outcome for hypothesis 1 was the rate of death from any cause. The primary outcome for hypothesis two was a composite of death from any cause and hospitalization for cardiac causes.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>There was no significant difference between medical therapy alone and medical therapy plus CABG for death from any cause, though participants that underwent CABG had lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes, death from any cause, or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. Adding SVR to CABG reduced the left ventricular volume, as compared with CABG alone. However, this anatomical change was not associated with a greater improvement in symptoms or exercise tolerance, or with a reduction in the rate of death or hospitalization for cardiac causes.</p>",

The role of low-dose mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists (MRAs) therapy as a neurohormonal antagonist is well established for the treatment of chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. However, the role of high-dose MRA therapy in AHF remained uncertain. A previous clinical trial suggested that the benefits of high-dose MRA therapy in AHF included lower natriuretic peptide levels, less congestion, better renal function, and less need for an intravenous diuretic. <br></p>\n<p>The use of intravenous loop diuretics can intensify secondary hyperaldosteronism among AHF patients, and hyperaldosteronism directly contributes to diuretic resistance in AHF.

Prescription of all other medications, including diuretics, was left at the discretion of the treating physician. The study drug was discontinued after 96 hours and further MRA use was left to the treating physician's discretion. The primary end point was the proportional change in the log NT-proBNP levels from randomization to 96 hours (or at the hospital discharge if the discharge occurred earlier than 96 hours). Secondary endpoints included: (1) a clinical congestion score; (2) dyspnea relief; (3) daily cumulative net urine output for up to 96 hours; (4) net weight change from baseline to 96 hours or discharge (whichever came first); (5) furosemide equivalents of the loop diuretic dosage at discharge; and (6) the development of in-hospital worsening HF, with signs and symptoms requiring additional therapy.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>There was no significant difference in the primary or secondary endpoints between the high-dose treatment arm and the usual care treatment arm. <br></p>",

    "description": "<p><u>Objective</u><br>The <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00608491\">CARRESS trial</a> examined the effectiveness of ultrafiltration compared with a strategy of diuretic-based stepped pharmacologic therapy on renal function and weight loss in patients with heart failure who have worsening renal function and persistent congestion.<br></p>\n<p><u>Background</u><br>Acute cardiorenal syndrome is defined as worsening renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. It occurs in 25 to 33% of patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Current heart failure treatments focus on removing excess fluid buildup, however administration of intravenous diuretics may contribute to worsening renal function. Venovenous ultrafiltration is one alternative therapy that may be effective in patients with acute decompensated heart failure complicated by acute cardiorenal syndrome and persistent congestion<br></p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>A total of 188 patients were randomized.<br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>Hospitalized subjects were randomly assigned to receive either ultrafiltration therapy or pharmacologic therapy. Ultrafiltration was performed at a fluid-removal rate of 200 ml per hour and loop diuretics were discontinued for the duration of the intervention. The addition of intravenous vasodilators or positive inotropic agents was prohibited, unless they were deemed to be necessary as rescue therapy. Patients assigned to stepped pharmacologic therapy received intravenous diuretics to manage congestion and maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 liters per day. In both groups, the assigned treatment strategy was to be continued until the signs and symptoms of congestion in the patient were reduced as much as possible. The primary end points were baseline changes in serum creatinine and weight as assessed at 96 hours after treatment assignment.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>The use of a stepped pharmacologic-therapy algorithm was superior to a strategy of ultrafiltration for the preservation of renal function, and there was a similar amount of weight loss between the two groups. Ultrafiltration was associated with a higher rate of adverse events (Bart, et al., 2012, PMID: <a href=\"http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23131078/\">23131078</a>).<br></p>",

Intravenous loop diuretics are an essential component of current treatment and are administered to approximately 90% of patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite decades of clinical experience with these agents, prospective data to guide the use of loop diuretics are sparse, and current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion. As a result, clinical practice varies widely with regard to both the mode of administration and the dosing.<br></p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>A total of 308 patients were enrolled between March 2008 and November 2009 at 26 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. <br></p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>The DOSE study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design. Patients were randomly assigned to either a low-dose strategy (total intravenous furosemide dose equal to their total daily oral loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents) or a high-dose strategy (total daily intravenous furosemide dose 2.5 times their total daily oral loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents) and to administration of furosemide either by intravenous bolus every 12 hours or by continuous intravenous infusion.<br></p>\n<p>The study treatment, with group assignments concealed, was continued for up to 72 hours. At 48 hours, the treating physician had the option of adjusting the diuretic strategy on the basis of the clinical response. An assessment of biomarkers, including creatinine, cystatin C, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, was performed at a central core laboratory at baseline, 72 hours, and 60 days. Patients were followed for clinical events to day 60. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours.<br></p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

The potential uses of the NHDR are broad, including providing matched controls for clinical trials, observing a cohort of untreated patients as part of a natural history study, or conducting comparative effectiveness research on a subpopulation with selected co-morbidities or drug treatment profiles. The SCD NHDR includes two multi-center SCD longitudinal cohort studies with extensive annual clinical data and patient surveys, the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC-I and SCDIC-II) and the Globin Research Network for Data and Discovery (GRNDaD). The SCDIC-I, initiated in 2017 and concluded in June 2022, enrolled over 2400 patients with SCD from 8 US treatment centers. The SCDIC-II reconsented 1220 of the SCDIC-I patients as well as enrolling an additional 450 new patients from the same 8 centers between September 2022 and October 2023, for a total of 1670 in SCDIC-II.

Heart failure is characterized by an imbalance between left ventricular (LV) performance and myocardial energy consumption. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests oxidative stress contributes to ventricular and vascular remodeling, and disease progression in heart failure. Targeting potential source(s) of oxidative stress, e.g. Xanthine oxidase (XO), was the focus of recent clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Increased XO activity has been shown to lead to production of superoxide and uric acid (UA). Serum uric acid levels are included in heart failure risk scores, and hyperuricemia is present in about 25% of patients with heart failure. Hyperuricemia is associated with exercise intolerance, reduced survival, and worsening symptoms. The EXACT-HF trial tested allopurinol, an inhibitor of XO, as a potential target therapy for hyperuricemic heart failure patients.</p>\n<p><u>Subjects</u><br>253 subjects were enrolled in the EXACT-HF study. 128 participants were randomized to the allopurinol arm, and of those participants, 119 completed the trial and 9 did not. 125 participants were randomized to the placebo arm, and of those participants, 116 completed the trial and 9 did not.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u><br>EXACT-HF was a multi-center, double-blind, placebo controlled, 24-week trial of allopurinol. Eligible participants had to be receiving a stable regimen for at least two weeks (3 months for beta-blockers) prior to randomization. Participants were randomized by an automated system to either the allopurinol or placebo arm, and started treatment within 12 hours of completing the baseline visit. During the first week, participants in both treatment arms received 300mg daily of the respective medications. For the following 23 weeks, participants in both treatment arms received 600mg daily of the respective medications. Patients unable to tolerate 600 mg were maintained on 300 mg.<br>The primary endpoint was a composite clinical endpoint (CCE) that classified a subject's clinical status as improved, worsened, or unchanged at 24 weeks. The CCE was determined based on the following: death; hospitalization, emergency room visit or emergent clinic visit for worsening HF; medication change for worsening HF; and Patient Global Assessment using a 7-point scale. Secondary endpoints at 12 and 24 weeks included changes in quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and submaximal exercise capacity as assessed by a 6-minute walk test.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u><br>Participants who received allopurinol had significantly less serum uric acid laboratory levels after 24 weeks; however, no significant difference was observed in the primary and secondary endpoints between the allopurinol and placebo-treated patients. Therefore, in high-risk HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated uric acid levels, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol failed to improve clinical status, exercise capacity, quality of life, or LVEF at 24 weeks (Circulation. 2015 May 19; 131(20):1763-71).<br></p>",

Abnormal cardiac metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of advanced heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). As heart failure progresses, these abnormalities become more pronounced and are observed in both patients with and without type 2 diabetes. At this time of this study, there was no heart failure therapy that targeted these metabolic abnormalities; however, in earlier clinical studies, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists showed cardioprotective effects in patients with advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is an endogenous incretin hormone that improves insulin sensitivity with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. This study was created to determine if use of GLP-1 agonists improved clinical stability in recently hospitalized patients with acute heart failure and reduced LVEF.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were 300 participants.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Participants were identified by hospital admission records and were enrolled during either the last 24 hours of his or her hospitalization for heart failure or the 2-week interval after the hospitalization.

ECG signal data is available with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003562\">phs003562</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if intensive glycemic control, multiple lipid management and intensive blood pressure control could prevent major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary hypotheses included treatment differences in other cardiovascular outcomes, total mortality, microvascular outcomes, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><u>Glycemia Trial:</u><br>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at rates two to four times higher than non-diabetic populations of similar demographic characteristics. They also experience increased rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. With the growing prevalence of obesity in the United States, CVD associated with type 2 diabetes is expected to become an even greater public health challenge in the coming decades than it is now. Expected increases in event rates will be associated with a concomitant rise in suffering and resource utilization.</p>\n<p>The ACCORD study investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors when compared to standard therapy (HbA1c between 7.0% and 7.9%). A separate analysis investigated whether reduction of blood glucose concentration decreases the rate of microvascular complications in these patients.</p>\n<p><u>Lipid Therapy Trial: </u><br>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease attributable, in part, to associated risk factors such as dyslipidemia. This is characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. The ACCORD Lipid Therapy trial was designed to test the effect of a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to raise HDL-C and lower triglyceride levels and uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C reduce the rate of CVD events compared to a strategy that only uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes that were at high risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p><u>Blood Pressure Trial:</u> <br>Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease at every level of systolic blood pressure. Because cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes is graded and continuous across the entire range of levels of systolic blood pressure, even at prehypertensive levels, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) recommended beginning drug treatment in patients with diabetes who have systolic blood pressures of 130 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of reducing systolic blood pressure to below 130 mm Hg. There is, however, a paucity of evidence from randomized clinical trials to support these recommendations. The ACCORD Blood Pressure trial tested the effect of a target systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg on major cardiovascular events among high-risk persons with type 2 diabetes compared to a strategy that targeted a SBP of &#x3C; 140 mm Hg.</p>\n<p><u>EYE Substudy:</u> <br>Diabetic retinopathy, an important microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Randomized, controlled clinical trials in cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes have shown the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control and intensive treatment of elevated blood pressure on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been implicated, in observational studies and small trials, as additional risk factors for the development of diabetic retinopathy and visual loss. The ACCORD EYE Substudy evaluated the effects of the ACCORD medical strategies on the progression of diabetic retinopathy in a subgroup of trial patients.</p>\n<p><u>MIND Substudy:</u> <br>Studies suggest that older persons with type 2 diabetes have at least twice the likelihood of developing late-life cognitive impairment or dementia compared to those without. The mechanisms underlying these cognitive disorders are increasingly thought to reflect a mixed pathology pattern with contributions from vascular, neurodegenerative and neurovascular processes. Pathophysiological mechanisms that have been described include inflammation, oxidative stress, energy imbalance, protein misfolding, glucocorticoid-mediated effects and differences in genetic susceptibilities. The ACCORD MIND substudy took as a premise that early intervention with the ACCORD therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control could mitigate the adverse effects of type 2 diabetes on the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>\n<p>10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c concentrations of 7.5% or more participated in the trial. Of these patients, 5518 were assigned to the lipid therapy arm and 4733 to the blood pressure arm.</p>\n<p><u>EYE Substudy: </u><br>A subgroup of 2856 participants was evaluated for the effects of the ACCORD interventions at 4 years on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Participants who, at baseline, had a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy that had been treated with laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy were excluded.</p>\n<p><u>MIND Substudy:</u> <br>A subgroup of 2977 participants was evaluated for cognitive function and brain volume. The ACCORD MIND substudy excluded participants aged &#x3C;55 years and those in the Veteran's Administration CCN (to retain the overall sex balance reflected in the other CCNs). Within ACCORD MIND a group of 632 participants participated in the MRI sub-study.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>Participants were randomly assigned to undergo either intensive glycemic control (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level &#x3C;6.0%) or standard therapy (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0 to 7.9%). Of these participants, 5518 with dyslipidemia were also randomly assigned, in a 2-by-2 factorial design, to receive simvastatin (to reduce low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol levels) in combination with either fenofibrate (to reduce triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol levels) or matching placebo. The remaining 4733 participants were randomly assigned, in a 2-by-2 factorial design, to undergo either intensive blood-pressure control (targeting a systolic blood pressure &#x3C;120 mm Hg) or standard therapy (targeting a systolic blood pressure &#x3C;140 mm Hg).

The presence of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure is associated with reduced functional capacity, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality.</p>\n<p>Despite growing recognition of the significance of iron deficiency, randomized multicenter trials exploring the utility of oral iron supplementation, a therapy that is inexpensive, readily available, and safe, have not been performed in patients with heart failure. Moreover, patient characteristics and biochemical profiles that may influence responsiveness to oral iron in patients with heart failure have not been defined. Results of intravenous iron repletion trials have been favorable, but regularly treating patients with intravenous iron products is expensive and poses logistical challenges for outpatients. Therefore, the HFN-IRONOUT study was initiated to investigate the efficacy of oral iron in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 225 participants were enrolled, 111 randomized to receive oral iron and 114 randomized to receive the placebo.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>The HFN-IRONOUT study was a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that enrolled participants at 23 sites in the United States.

The clinical phenotyping and outcomes data from the trial are associated with ACCORD-BioLINCC, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bihttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003551\">phs003551</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br></p>\n<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if intensive glycemic control, multiple lipid management and intensive blood pressure control could prevent major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary hypotheses included treatment differences in other cardiovascular outcomes, total mortality, microvascular outcomes, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p><u>Glycemia Trial:</u><br>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at rates two to four times higher than non-diabetic populations of similar demographic characteristics. They also experience increased rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. With the growing prevalence of obesity in the United States, CVD associated with type 2 diabetes is expected to become an even greater public health challenge in the coming decades than it is now. Expected increases in event rates will be associated with a concomitant rise in suffering and resource utilization.<br>The ACCORD study investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors when compared to standard therapy (HbA1c between 7.0% and 7.9%). A separate analysis investigated whether reduction of blood glucose concentration decreases the rate of microvascular complications in these patients.</p>\n<p><u>Lipid Therapy Trial:</u><br>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease attributable, in part, to associated risk factors such as dyslipidemia. This is characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. The ACCORD Lipid Therapy trial was designed to test the effect of a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to raise HDL-C and lower triglyceride levels and uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C reduce the rate of CVD events compared to a strategy that only uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes that were at high risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p><u>Blood Pressure Trial:</u><br>Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease at every level of systolic blood pressure. Because cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes is graded and continuous across the entire range of levels of systolic blood pressure, even at prehypertensive levels, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) recommended beginning drug treatment in patients with diabetes who have systolic blood pressures of 130 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of reducing systolic blood pressure to below 130 mm Hg. There is, however, a paucity of evidence from randomized clinical trials to support these recommendations. The ACCORD Blood Pressure trial tested the effect of a target systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg on major cardiovascular events among high-risk persons with type 2 diabetes compared to a strategy that targeted a SBP of &#x3C; 140 mm Hg.</p>\n<p><u>EYE Substudy:</u><br>Diabetic retinopathy, an important microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Randomized, controlled clinical trials in cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes have shown the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control and intensive treatment of elevated blood pressure on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been implicated, in observational studies and small trials, as additional risk factors for the development of diabetic retinopathy and visual loss. The ACCORD EYE Substudy evaluated the effects of the ACCORD medical strategies on the progression of diabetic retinopathy in a subgroup of trial patients.</p>\n<p><u>MIND Substudy:</u><br>Studies suggest that older persons with type 2 diabetes have at least twice the likelihood of developing late-life cognitive impairment or dementia compared to those without. The mechanisms underlying these cognitive disorders are increasingly thought to reflect a mixed pathology pattern with contributions from vascular, neurodegenerative and neurovascular processes. Pathophysiological mechanisms that have been described include inflammation, oxidative stress, energy imbalance, protein misfolding, glucocorticoid-mediated effects and differences in genetic susceptibilities. The ACCORD MIND substudy took as a premise that early intervention with the ACCORD therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control could mitigate the adverse effects of type 2 diabetes on the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Subjects</strong></p>\n<p>10,251 patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c concentrations of 7.5% or more participated in the trial. Of these patients, 5518 were assigned to the lipid therapy arm and 4733 to the blood pressure arm.</p>\n<p><u>EYE Substudy:</u><br>A subgroup of 2856 patients was evaluated for the effects of the ACCORD interventions at 4 years on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Patients who, at baseline, had a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy that had been treated with laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy were excluded.</p>\n<p><u>MIND Substudy:</u><br>A subgroup of 2977 patients was evaluated for cognitive function and brain volume. The ACCORD MIND substudy excluded patients aged &#x3C;55 years and those in the Veteran's Administration CCN (to retain the overall sex balance reflected in the other CCNs). Within ACCORD MIND a group of 632 patients participated in the MRI sub-study.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>Patients were randomly assigned to undergo either intensive glycemic control (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level &#x3C;6.0%) or standard therapy (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0 to 7.9%). Of these patients, 5518 with dyslipidemia were also randomly assigned, in a 2-by-2 factorial design, to receive simvastatin (to reduce low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol levels) in combination with either fenofibrate (to reduce triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol levels) or matching placebo. The remaining 4733 patients were randomly assigned, in a 2-by-2 factorial design, to undergo either intensive blood-pressure control (targeting a systolic blood pressure &#x3C;120 mm Hg) or standard therapy (targeting a systolic blood pressure &#x3C;140 mm Hg).

At the time of the RELAX trial, clinical trials of renin-angiotensin system antagonists had not demonstrated improvement in outcomes or clinical status in HFpEF, and effective therapies were needed. Phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) metabolizes the nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptide (NP) systems' second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and thus may limit beneficial NO and NP actions in the heart, vasculature and kidney. Pre-clinical studies suggest that inhibition of PDE-5 reverses adverse cardiac structural and functional remodeling and enhances vascular, neuroendocrine and renal function. In clinical studies, PDE-5 inhibitor therapy improved exercise tolerance and clinical status in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). A small, single-center study in HFpEF observed improved hemodynamics, left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, right ventricular (RV) systolic function, LV hypertrophy and lung function with chronic PDE-5 inhibition as compared to placebo. In aggregate, these studies suggested the potential for PDE-5 inhibition to ameliorate several key pathophysiological perturbations in HFpEF, and thus improve exercise capacity and clinical status.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 216 participants were enrolled in the trial with 113 in the Sildenafil group and 103 in the placebo group.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Participants who met screening criteria underwent baseline studies including a history and physical examination, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPXT), six-minute walk distance, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ), echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and phlebotomy for biomarkers.

If the dose was well tolerated at 12 weeks, it was increased to 60 mg TID for another 12 weeks. If side effects developed, study staff could recommend discontinuation or return to a lower or previously tolerated dose of study drug. Sildenafil levels 2 hours after a scheduled dose of study drug were obtained at 12 and 24 weeks.</p>\n<p>The primary endpoint was exercise capacity determined by change in peak oxygen consumption during the CPXT after 24 weeks of therapy.

Further, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension in adults over 50 years of age. Observational studies have shown a monotonic increase in cardiovascular risk with systolic blood pressures above 115 mm Hg; however, general population clinical trials have only documented the benefits of lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 150 mm Hg. A 2007 expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designated the hypothesis that lowering the systolic blood pressure goal to a level &#x3C;120 mm Hg as the most important hypothesis to test in reducing hypertension related complications in those without diabetes.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Subjects</u></strong></p>\n<p>A total of 9361 participants were enrolled, with 4,678 randomized to the intensive-treatment group and 4,683 randomized to the standard-treatment group.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design</u></strong></p>\n<p>SPRINT was a randomized, single blinded (outcome adjudicators were blinded to treatment assignment) treatment trial with participants randomized to a systolic blood-pressure target of either less than 140 mm Hg (the standard-treatment group) or less than 120 mm Hg (the intensive-treatment group). Following randomization, baseline hypertensive regimens were adjusted in accordance with study treatment algorithms established for each group. The study formulary included all major classes of antihypertensive agents. Investigators could prescribe other antihypertensive medications, but the use of drug classes with the strongest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes was encouraged. This included thiazide-type diuretics as the first-line agent, loop diuretics for participants with advanced chronic kidney disease, and beta-adrenergic blockers for participants with coronary artery disease. Medications for participants in the intensive-treatment group were adjusted on a monthly basis to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. Medications for participants in the standard-treatment group were adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 139 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced if systolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg on a single visit or less than 135 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Lifestyle modification was encouraged as part of the management strategy.</p>\n<p>Participants were seen monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Demographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. A structured interview was used in both groups every 3 months to obtain self-reported cardiovascular disease outcomes. Medical records and electrocardiograms were obtained for documentation of events. Incidences of hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and bradycardia that were evaluated in an emergency department were included in adverse event reporting.

    "description": "<p><u>Objectives</u><br>To test the two independent hypotheses that when compared to placebo, addition of: (1) low dose dopamine; or (2) low dose nesiritide to diuretic therapy will enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>A primary treatment goal in acute heart failure is to achieve adequate decongestion while avoiding renal dysfunction and other side effects. Patients with acute heart failure and moderate or severe renal dysfunction are at risk for inadequate decongestion and worsening renal function - both of which are associated with worse outcomes. Renal adjuvant therapies that enhance decongestion and preserve renal function during treatment of acute heart failure are needed.</p>\n<p>Dopamine is an endogenous catecholamine which, at low doses, may selectively activate dopamine receptors and promote renal vasodilatation. Previous studies have suggested that the addition of low dose dopamine to diuretic therapy enhances decongestion and preserves renal function during diuretic therapy in acute heart failure; however, these studies were small with variable study designs and dopamine doses.</p>\n<p>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac peptide with vasodilating, renin and aldosterone inhibiting, natriuretic and diuretic properties. Nesiritide is human recombinant BNP approved for management of acute heart failure. The recommended dose lowers blood pressure and atrial pressures and produces modest improvement in dyspnea, but does not favorably impact clinical outcomes or renal function, potentially due to its hypotensive effects. Small studies using low dose nesiritide in acute heart failure and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated favorable effects on urine output and renal function.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation (ROSE) trial was initiated to determine the benefits and safety of intravenous administration of low dose nesiritide or low dose dopamine in patients with congestive heart failure and kidney dysfunction.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u><br>A total of 360 participants were enrolled.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Participants were enrolled within 24 hours of hospital admission and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the nesiritide or dopamine strategies. Participants randomized to the dopamine strategy were randomized in a double-blind 2:1 ratio to low dose dopamine (2 µg/kg/min for 72 hours infused via local guideline stipulated vascular access) or placebo. Participants randomized to the nesiritide strategy were randomized in a double-blind 2:1 ratio to low dose nesiritide (0.005 μg/kg/min for 72 hours infused via peripheral intravenous access without initial bolus) or placebo.</p>\n<p>All participants received open-label, intravenous loop diuretic treatment with a recommended total daily dose equal to 2.5x the total daily oral outpatient furosemide (or equivalent) dose at 7 days prior to admission up to a maximum of 600 mg/day. Participants naive to outpatient loop diuretics received 80 mg/day of intravenous furosemide. One-half of the total daily diuretic dose was administered as a bolus twice daily for at least 24 hours. Use of other medications and diuretic dosing after 24 hours were at the discretion of the clinician. All participants were placed on a 2000 mg sodium diet and 2000 cc fluid restriction. After the primary endpoint assessment at 72 hours, study drug was discontinued and subsequent treatment was at the clinician's discretion. The two co-primary endpoints were the 72-hour cumulative urinary volume as an index of decongestion efficacy and the change in cystatin-C from randomization to 72 hours as a measure of renal function preservation.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In participants with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction, neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function when added to diuretic therapy.</p>",

The FHS began by recruiting an Original Cohort of 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and 62 from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, who had not yet developed overt symptoms of cardiovascular disease or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Original cohort Exam 1 took place between 1948 and 1953. Since that time the cohort has had a total of 32 biennial exams (ending in 2014) and event follow-up through 2022.</p>\n<p>In 1971, the FHS added the Offspring cohort, comprising 5124 children whose parents were enrolled in the Original cohort and the spouses of the children. This cohort on average has been examined every three to four years. However, there was an eight year gap between Exam 1 and Exam 2 and a seven year gap between Exam 7 and Exam 8. The latest exam (10) was completed in 2022.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the transgenerational FHS design was facilitated with the recruitment of 4095 children of the Offspring cohort (Third Generation), and 103 spouses of the Offspring who were not previously enrolled in the study (New Offspring Spouses, NOS).

Although evidence-based drug and device therapies decrease mortality, hospitalizations, and HF symptoms and improve quality of life, many patients treated with these regimens often remain burdened by dyspnea and fatigue, diminished exercise tolerance, reduced quality of life, recurrent hospitalizations, and early mortality.</p>\n<p>Whereas rest was traditionally recommended for HF patients, there has been evidence that physical deconditioning may play a key role in the progression of symptoms and poor outcomes. Previous studies have shown positive effects of exercise training on exercise capacity, quality of life, and biomarkers and suggest that exercise training might improve survival and decrease HF hospitalizations. Nonetheless, there remains a safety concern regarding exercise training in HF and a large scale, multicenter, controlled clinical trial was needed to provide definitive clinical outcome data.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 2,331 participants were randomized. 2,130 consented to share data with non-commercial entities, and 1,753 consented to share for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>All participants underwent baseline cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Test results were reviewed by investigators to identify significant arrhythmias or ischemia that would prevent safe exercise training, to determine appropriate levels of exercise training, and to establish training heart rate ranges. Demographics, socioeconomic status, past medical history, current medications, physical exam, and the most recent laboratory tests were obtained prior to randomization. All participants received detailed self-management educational materials which included information on medications, fluid management, symptom exacerbation, sodium intake, and physical activity.</p>\n<p>Participants randomized to the exercise training arm first participated in a structured, group-based, supervised exercise program, with a goal of 3 sessions per week for a total of 36 sessions in 3 months. The primary exercises were walking, treadmill, or stationary cycling. Exercise was initiated at 15 to 30 minutes per session at a heart rate corresponding to 60% of heart rate reserve, and was increased after 6 sessions to 30 to 35 minutes duration and 70% of heart rate reserve. Participants began home-based exercise after completing 18 supervised sessions and were to fully transition to home exercise after 36 supervised sessions. The target training regimen for home exercise was 5 times per week for 40 minutes at a heart rate of 60% to 70% of heart rate reserve.</p>\n<p>Participants randomized to the usual care group were not provided with a formal exercise prescription. To provide comparable levels of attention from study personnel, all participants were called every 2 weeks for the first 9 months, monthly until 24 months of follow-up, and quarterly thereafter. Participants returned for clinic visits every 3 months for the first 2 years of participation and yearly thereafter for up to 4 years. Follow-up assessments included cardiopulmonary exercise testing, a 6-minute walk test, and a physical activity questionnaire.</p>\n<p>The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization. Secondary end points included all-cause mortality, the composite of cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and the composite of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>After adjustment for highly prognostic predictors of the primary end point, exercise training was associated with modestly significant reductions for both all-cause mortality or hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization.</p>",

Standard treatment for HF includes diuretics to control fluid, and drugs called \"neurohormonal antagonists\" (such as beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors) to help the heart work more efficiently. The natriuretic peptides, specifically NT-pro-BNP, are biomarkers that reflect HF severity and are significantly associated with adverse outcomes in HF. Smaller studies have evaluated adjusting HF therapy based on natriuretic peptide levels (“guided therapy”) with inconsistent results.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **A total of 894 participants were enrolled at 45 sites in the United States and Canada, with 446 randomized to the NT-pro-BNP-guided strategy treatment group and 448 randomized to the usual care treatment group.</p>\n<p>**Design: **<a href=\"https://www.guideit.com/\">GUIDE-IT</a> was a multicenter randomized clinical trial with participants randomized to either the NT-pro-BNP-guided therapy strategy or usual care. Given the nature of the study intervention, treatment assignment was not blinded. For participants randomized to the NT-pro-BNP-guided strategy, clinicians were instructed to titrate HF therapy to target an NT-pro-BNP level &#x3C;1,000 pg/mL. Specific adjustments of therapy for individual participants were at the discretion of the treating physician, but sites were encouraged to prioritize titration of neurohormonal antagonists over diuretics unless there was clinical evidence of congestion or volume overload. For participants in either group, investigators were provided with the most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) practice guidelines for the management of HF and specific information on target doses of proven medical therapies.</p>\n<p>After an initial visit at 2 and 6 weeks, visits occurred every 3 months throughout the remainder of the study. After therapy adjustment for HF (whether driven by NT-pro-BNP levels or clinical reasons), participants had a 2-week follow-up visit for reassessment. All participants in either group also had blinded NT-pro-BNP concentrations measured in a core laboratory at each study visit.</p>\n<p>The primary end point was the composite of time-to-first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. Secondary end points included all-cause mortality, total hospitalizations for HF, days alive and not hospitalized for cardiovascular reasons, the individual components on the primary end point, and adverse events.</p>\n<p>**Conclusions: **The guided strategy intervention was stopped in July of 2016 (median follow-up of 15 months) after the study met prespecified inefficacy criteria. Compared to usual care, a strategy of NT-pro-BNP-guided therapy was not more effective in improving time-to-first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality in high-risk participants with HFrEF.</p>",

Epidemiologic data from middle-aged adults indicate that OSA is common, with prevalence rates of 4% in men and 2% in women. Prior studies implicated OSA as a risk factor for the development of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and consequently premature death. Questions arose as to whether an increased propensity for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases was limited to only those with frank OSA or whether more subtle forms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) would also confer elevated risk. Further evidence was also needed to clarify whether, SDB, including OSA, is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Known cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk factors such as obesity and smoking are commonly present in those with SDB; therefore, apparent associations between SDB and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases may have resulted from the effects of these concomitant risk factors. Moreover, there was no understanding as to whether such factors as race, age, gender, and prevalent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease might interact with SDB to alter future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk. Mechanisms underlying any propensity to develop cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease with SDB had not been firmly established (Quan, et al., 1997, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9493915/\">9493915</a>).</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>Participants in SHHS were recruited from nine existing NHLBI epidemiological studies in which data on cardiovascular risk factors had been collected previously. The “parent” cohorts included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two sites of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) - Three sites of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) - The Framingham Offspring Cohort - The Strong Heart Study (SHS) sites in South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Arizona - The New York Hypertension Cohorts - The Tucson Epidemiologic Study of Airways Obstructive Diseases and the Health and Environment Study\nFrom these parent cohorts, a sample of participants who met the inclusion criteria (age 40 years or older; no history of treatment of sleep apnea; no tracheostomy; no current home oxygen therapy) was invited to participate in the baseline examination of the SHHS, which included an initial polysomnogram (SHHS-1). Several cohorts over-sampled snorers in order to increase the study-wide prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. In all, 6441 individuals were enrolled between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1998.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During exam cycle 3 (January 2001-June 2003), a second polysomnogram (SHHS-2) was obtained in 3295 of the participants.</p>\n<p>Due to sovereignty issues, Strong Heart Study participants are not included in the shared SHHS data. Data from a total of 5839 participants (1920 ARIC, 1249 CHS, 997 Framingham Offspring and OMNI 1, and 1673 from other studies), consenting to share data are available.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>The Sleep Heart Health Study added in-home polysomnography to the data collected in each of the parent studies at a baseline SHHS exam and a follow-up approximately 4 years later. Using the Compumedics PS polysomnograph, sleep studies were obtained in an unattended setting, usually in the homes of the participants, by trained and certified technicians. The recording montage consisted of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C3/A2 and C4/A1 EEGs, sampled at 125 Hz - right and left electrooculograms (EOGs), sampled at 50 Hz - a bipolar submental electromyogram (EMG), sampled at 125 Hz - thoracic and abdominal excursions (THOR and ABDO), recorded by inductive plethysmography bands and sampled at 10 Hz - \"airflow\" detected by a nasal-oral thermocouple (Protec, Woodinville, WA), sampled at 10 Hz - finger-tip pulse oximetry (Nonin, Minneapolis, MN) sampled at 1 Hz - ECG from a bipolar lead, sampled at 125 Hz for most SHHS-1 studies and 250 Hz for SHHS-2 studies - Heart rate (PR) derived from the ECG and sampled at 1 Hz - body position (using a mercury gauge sensor) - ambient light (on/off, by a light sensor secured to the recording garment)\nThis montage provides data on the occurrence of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep stages, heart rate, oximetry and on arousals. Each participant in the parent studies was also asked to complete the Sleep Habits Questionnaire which covers usual sleep pattern, snoring, and sleepiness.</li>\n</ul>",

Two approaches have been developed to prevent sudden death among patients with CHF: therapy with amiodarone and therapy with an ICD. However, most of the mortality data on amiodarone and ICD therapy at the time of the study had been obtained in clinical trials performed after myocardial infarction in patients without CHF or those with ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, more data was needed to guide these therapies in patients who did not meet these criteria.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were a total of 2521 participants. 847 were randomly assigned to placebo, 845 to amiodarone, and 829 to ICD therapy.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Before randomization, participants underwent electrocardiography, a 6-minute walk test, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography, liver and thyroid function studies, and chest radiography. Participants were required, if clinically reasonable, to receive treatment with a beta-blocker and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, as well as an aldosterone antagonist, aspirin, and statins, when appropriate. Participants were randomly assigned in equal proportions to receive placebo, amiodarone, or a single-chamber ICD programmed to shock-only mode.</p>\n<p>Participants assigned to amiodarone or matching placebo began therapy as outpatients immediately after randomization. Placebo and amiodarone were administered as a loading dose of 800 mg/day for one week, 400 mg/day for three weeks, and then as a daily maintenance dosage according to weight and bradycardia status. Participants assigned to ICD therapy received their device a median of three days after randomization. The goal of ICD therapy was to treat only rapid, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Dual-chamber or biventricular devices, or antitachycardia or rate-response pacing therapies were not permitted. The ICD was uniformly programmed to have a detection rate of 187 beats per minute or more.

Please note that use of biospecimens in genetic research is subject to a tiered consent.</p>\n<p><u>Objectives </u><br>The TOPCAT trial evaluated the effectiveness of aldosterone antagonist therapy in reducing cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, and heart failure hospitalization in patients who have heart failure with preserved systolic function.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Many patients with heart failure have a normal, or near-normal, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Such patients share similar signs and symptoms as patients who have heart failure and a reduced LVEF, as well as an impaired quality of life and a poor prognosis. However, at the time of TOPCAT, the benefit of medical therapies for heart failure were limited to those with a reduced LVEF. Due to a lack of favorable evidence from clinical trials, clinical guidelines offered no specific recommendations for the management of heart failure in patients with preserved LVEF, except for attention to coexisting conditions.</p>\n<p>Among patients with heart failure and a reduced LVEF and those with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing overall mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. In small mechanistic studies involving patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular function, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists improved measures of diastolic function. However, rigorous testing was needed regarding their effect on clinical outcomes in patients with preserved LVEF. Therefore, the TOPCAT trial was initiated to determine whether treatment with spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, would improve clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a relatively preserved LVEF.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 3445 participants were enrolled, with 1722 assigned to the spironolactone group and 1723 assigned to the placebo group. Among these, 2464 participants were enrolled via the hospitalization stratum and 981 were enrolled via the BNP stratum.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>TOPCAT was a phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled trial. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive either spironolactone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified according to whether the patient met the criterion for previous hospitalization or BNP elevation. The baseline visit included assessment of socio-demographics, physical characteristics, medical history, lifestyle factors, laboratory measures, electrocardiography variables and health-related quality of life and functional status.</p>\n<p>Study drugs were initially administered at a dose of 15 mg once daily, which was increased as tolerated to a maximum of 45 mg daily during the first four months after randomization. Subsequent dose adjustments were made as required and subjects continued to receive other treatments for heart failure and co-existing illnesses. Measurement of potassium and creatinine levels was required within 1 week after a change in the study-drug dose and at each scheduled study visit. Follow-up visits to monitor symptoms, medications, and events and to dispense study drug were scheduled every four months during the subject's first year on the study, and every six months thereafter. The mean follow-up interval was 3.3 years in each study group. Repository blood and urine samples were collected at the baseline and 1 year visits from consenting subjects.</p>\n<p>The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure management, new onset of diabetes mellitus or atrial fibrillation, and quality of life.</p>\n<p>A subset of subjects also participated in the Echocardiography or Echocardiography and Vascular Stiffness ancillary studies. Echocardiography, and additionally tonometry in the Echocardiography and Vascular Stiffness study, were performed at baseline and at either 12 or 18 months following randomization. If the subject was already enrolled in the TOPCAT trial at the time the ancillary study was initiated, but had not yet reached the 18 month visit, baseline was determined via a retrospective analysis performed on any echocardiographic images completed within 60 days prior to TOPCAT enrollment and no tonometry was performed if applicable.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. However, the drug reduced the secondary endpoint of heart failure hospitalization incidence.</p>",

However, there are no proven effective medical treatments for this syndrome. Evidence suggests that impairments in nitric oxide availability have a potentially important role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p>\n<p>Unlike organic nitrates, inorganic nitrite is converted to nitric oxide in the presence of hypoxia and acidosis, conditions that develop during exercise. Because the cardiac, vascular, and skeletal muscle abnormalities that limit physical capacity and contribute to symptoms in patients with HFpEF characteristically develop during exercise, inorganic nitrite may provide the best way to target nitric oxide delivery precisely at the time of greatest need. The HFN-INDIE trial was initiated to test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, longer-term use of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite would enhance peak exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 105 participants were randomized. 53 were randomized to receive nitrite first and 52 were randomized to receive placebo first.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>HFN-INDIE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After enrollment, patients underwent baseline studies to determine eligibility. All patients were required to display objective exercise limitation, evidenced by reduced peak oxygen consumption (V̇O<sub>2</sub>) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing of less than 75% predicted, with a respiratory exchange ratio indicative of maximal effort (≥1.0). Following qualifying exercise testing, eligible participants received an open-label, single-dose run-in of inhaled, nebulized sodium nitrite (80 mg) to assess tolerability, symptoms, and orthostatic vital signs. Patients developing hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x3C;90 mm Hg seated or standing), light-headedness, or any other intolerance were categorized as a run-in failure and were not randomized. Following the baseline studies, eligible patients were randomly assigned to either receive nitrite first or to receive placebo first. Study drug was administered 3 times a day by nebulizer. During each 6-week period, patients were instructed to take no study drug for the first 2 weeks (baseline phase during the first period and washout phase during the second period), followed by 46 mg 3 times daily for 1 week, and then 80 mg 3 times daily for 3 weeks. After the first period, patients returned to the study center to receive the crossover study drug.</p>\n<p>The prespecified primary end point was peak V̇o2, measured as the highest 30-second average during upright cycle ergometry, during the 4-week period in which patients were receiving inorganic nitrite as compared with placebo. Accelerometry, health-related quality-of-life scores on the self-administered Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), echocardiographic indicators of cardiac filling pressures measured at trough drug levels (E/e' ratio, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left atrial volume index; lower scores indicate better health for all), ventilatory efficiency (VE/V̇co2, lower indicating better health), exercise time (higher indicating better health), and NT-proBNP levels (lower indicating better health) were also collected.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>Among patients with HFpEF, administration of inhaled inorganic nitrite for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity.</p>\n<p>Borlaug et al., 2018, PMID: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30398602\">30398602</a>.</p>",

Access differs from many other dbGaP accessions.</p>\n<p><u>Objectives</u><br>This study was initiated in 1986, primarily to evaluate the effects of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, on long-term mortality and major morbidity in a group of participants with left ventricular dysfunction. Two large separate trials were run concurrently as part of SOLVD: 1) a prevention trial of participants with low ejection fraction but no overt symptoms of CHF and, 2) a treatment trial of participants with low ejection fraction and symptoms of CHF. In addition, participants at selected sites were entered into substudies to evaluate the effect of enalapril on a number of intermediate outcomes such as right and left ventricular function and hemodynamics, LV mass and wall stress, hormones, arrhythmias, exercise capacity, and quality of life in subsets of participants. Lastly, a registry of 6,336 participants with congestive heart failure of LV dysfunction was designed to describe the clinical course of an unselected group of participants.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a major and increasingly recognized public health problem. The recognition that participants with CHF often have elevated peripheral vascular resistance has led to the introduction of vasodilator therapy, which has emerged as an important component of its treatment. Of the vasodilators, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appeared to be the most promising. In 1985, little was known about the impact of any long-term drug treatment on survival.</p>\n<p>SOLVD Registry: The SOLVD Registry is a hospital-based observational study, conducted at selected SOLVD hospitals, of participants with at least moderate left-ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤ 45%) and/or radiologically confirmed heart failure. It consists of a main study (n=6,273) and a substudy (n=898). Although there is overlap between the Registry and the SOLVD trials, the Registry sample is not a subset of SOLVD nor is it the pool of participants eligible for both trials.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>A total of 2,569 participants were enrolled into the treatment study and 4,228 participants were enrolled in the prevention study. The dataset available through the NHLBI contains the prevention and treatment study data as well as the registry data.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>In the prevention trial, a significant reduction in the incidence of heart failure and the rate of related hospitalizations was observed for participants in the enalapril arm. A statistically significant reduction in mortality was not observed in the enalapril treatment arm; however, there was a trend toward fewer total deaths and deaths due to cardiovascular causes among the enalapril participants (SOLVD Investigators, et al., 1992, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1463530/\">1463530</a>).</p>",

The Ketoconazole arm of the KARMA study was later stopped due to an inability to show efficacy. Participants continued to be randomized to the respiratory management arms of the study (ARMA), which compared two ventilator strategies: a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg versus 12 mL/kg. The LARMA phase of the study investigated the efficacy of Lisofylline and Respiratory Management.

Specific aims included: to establish whether the results of Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) trials can be generalized to the larger population of participants that experience cardiac arrest; to more fully establish the burden of cardiac arrest; and to examine the relationships between variation in EMS structure and process, regional and periodic factors, and participant outcomes.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Cardiac arrest is a common, serious, debilitating and costly public health problem. Although there has been a steady decline in morbidity and mortality from most cardiovascular diseases, high mortality rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests continue to pose a challenge for healthcare providers and a significant public health burden. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was established in 2004 to conduct clinical research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury with the overall goal of improving resuscitation outcomes. Participant and care characteristics can predict favorable outcomes in cardiac arrests, but there is still a wide variation in outcomes that is not well understood. EMS factors such as service level, number of responding providers, use of procedures or drugs in the field, training, quality assurance/feedback, and response time intervals also vary significantly by region. Variations in geographic, socioeconomic and periodic factors may also be associated with differences in outcomes.</p>\n<p>Prior to ROC Cardiac Epistry, there were no North American population-based registries for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Therefore there was a need for standardized data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in diverse geographic locations in order to identify the independent effects of prognostic or treatment factors accounting for variations in survival.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were 120,306 participants.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>ROC Epistry collected standardized data regarding episode-specific factors, participant demographics, clinical information, pre-hospital interventions and disposition, hospital information, and participant outcome for all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the ROC regions. Each ROC site had to ensure capture of all eligible cases within the EMS service areas. Out-of-hospital data were extracted from existing databases whenever possible and augmented with targeted review of EMS reports. Hospital data were abstracted directly from the hospital file in most cases. Alternative methods included linkage to death registries and obituaries if the death occurred within 30 days. Sites submitted data using a web-based interface or batch uploads. Participants were not contacted directly.</p>",

Biospecimens from ARDSNet-ARMA/KARMA/LARMA include plasma, serum and urine. Please note that use of biospecimens in genetic research is subject to a tiered consent.</p>\n<p><u>Objectives </u><br>The ARDS Network is a consortium of clinical centers and a coordinating center to design and test novel therapies for the treatment of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The primary objective of the KARMA trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of Ketoconazole and Respiratory Management in the treatment of ALI and ARDS. The Ketoconazole arm of the study was later stopped due to an inability to show efficacy. Participants continued to be randomized to the respiratory management arms of the study (ARMA), which compared two ventilator strategies: a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg versus 12 mL/kg. The LARMA phase of the study investigated the efficacy of Lisofylline and Respiratory Management.</p>\n<p><u>Background </u><br>Participants suffering from ARDS are extremely ill, require mechanical ventilation and, despite improvements in medical care and technology, had a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. An excessive inflammatory response is characteristic of ALI of which ARDS represents the most severe end of the pathophysiologic spectrum. The inflammatory response includes increased numbers of neutrophils activated to produce cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen intermediates. Pulmonary injury may also be enhanced by alveolar and tissue macrophages as a producer of vasoactive substances, neutrophil chemoattractants, and procoagulant substances. Ketoconazole, a synthetic antifungal imidazole, also has anti-inflammatory activities and may inhibit neutrophil recruitment via several different pathways known to be involved in the development of ALI and ARDS. Lisofylline causes a marked decrease in the circulating levels of the major oxidizable species of free fatty acids and also inhibits proinflammatory intracellular signaling. Mechanical ventilation in participants with ALI and ARDS have traditionally used tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight. These large tidal volumes are often necessary to achieve normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH, but may induce inflammatory responses through disruption of pulmonary epithelium and endothelium. Mechanical ventilation at lower tidal volumes may reduce injurious lung stretch and decrease the inflammatory response.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>The Ketoconazole and Lisofylline trials were designed as 2 x 2 factorials and included 220 participants in each trial. A total of 860 participants were randomized into the ventilator management trial. Participants enrolled in the Lisofylline or Ketoconozole studies had to be concurrently enrolled in the ventilator management study and were first randomized into a ventilator strategy and then to drug or placebo.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions </u><br>Ketoconazole was found to be safe but did not reduce mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or improve lung function. Lisofylline was also found to be safe and to have no beneficial effect for participants with ALI or ARDS. Ventilation at lower tidal volumes resulted in reduced mortality and an increase in the number of days without ventilator support.

The project has two components: community surveillance of morbidity and mortality; and repeated examinations of a representative cohort of men and women in each community. The community surveillance involves abstracting hospital records and death certificates and investigating out-of-hospital deaths. The representative cohorts include approximately 4,000 persons from each community.</p>\n<p>Community surveillance data includes detailed hospital record abstraction, ECG tracings, and event adjudication.

Fluid leaks from blood vessels into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. Recovery from this form of acute respiratory failure requires that the pulmonary edema resolve. The resolution of alveolar edema is driven by active transport of sodium and chloride ions from the luminal space across both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, creating an osmotic gradient for the reabsorption of water. In the ex vivo human lung, the rate of alveolar fluid clearance can be doubled by treatment with a cyclic AMP beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.</p>\n<p>On the basis of the preclinical observations that treatment with beta-2-agonists could reduce pulmonary edema and accelerate the rate of alveolar fluid clearance, the ALTA study was designed and undertaken with the hypothesis that treatment of participants with ALI/ARDS with beta-agonist therapy would accelerate the resolution of alveolar edema and improve clinical outcomes.</p>\n<p><u>Participants </u><br>There were 282 participants.</p>\n<p><u>Design </u><br>Study staff conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which participants were randomized to receive aerosolized albuterol (5 mg) or saline placebo every 4 hours for up to 10 days.

The type and inflammatory activity of eicosanoids liberated during inflammation depends on the membrane phospholipid composition: omega 6 (n-6) fatty acid arachidonate yields highly reactive and inflammatory dienoic prostaglandins and series 4 leukotrienes, whereas omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids favor production of less active and potentially anti-inflammatory trienoic prostaglandins and series 5 leukotrienes. Participants at risk of developing ALI have n-3 levels approximately 25% of normal and those with established ALI have n-3 levels as low as 6% of normal, suggesting a potential role for n-3 dietary supplementation in participants with ALI.</p>\n<p>Three randomized controlled studies, conducted in participants with ALI or sepsis-induced respiratory failure, demonstrated an association between the administration of an enteral formula enriched in n-3 fatty acids, GLA, and antioxidants and improved oxygenation and respiratory physiology compared with an unenriched, high-fat formula. However, interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample sizes and as-treated analyses of only those participants who tolerated full enteral nutrition.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **The total number of participants in the study was 272.</p>\n<p>**Design: **Participants were stratified by hospital and the presence of shock at baseline and then randomized to receive either twice-daily enteral supplementation of n-3 fatty acids, GLA, and antioxidants (n-3 supplement) or an isocaloric-isovolemic carbohydrate-rich control. Participants were also simultaneously randomized to a separate ongoing trial (the EDEN study) comparing low- vs full-calorie enteral nutrition in a 2×2 factorial design.</p>\n<p>The n-3 or control supplement was administered enterally as twice-daily boluses of 120 mL beginning within 6 hours of randomization. Dosing continued until the earliest of 21 days, 48 hours of unassisted breathing, or extubation.

The majority of these deaths result from hypovolemic shock or severe brain injury. Participants in hypovolemic shock develop a state of systemic tissue ischemia then a subsequent reperfusion injury at the time of fluid resuscitation. Conventional resuscitation involves the IV administration of a large volume of isotonic or slightly hypotonic (lactated ringers, LR) solutions beginning in the prehospital setting. Although not conclusive, prior studies have suggested that alternative resuscitation with hypertonic saline (7.5%) solutions may reduce morbidity or mortality in these participants. Furthermore, hypertonic fluids may have specific advantages in the brain-injured participant, as they may aid in the rapid restoration of cerebral perfusion and prevent extravascular fluid sequestration, thereby limiting secondary brain injury. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that hypertonicity significantly alters the activation of inflammatory cells, an effect that may reduce subsequent organ injury from ischemia-reperfusion and decrease nosocomial infection. The majority of previous clinical trials have focused on the use of HSD. The potential for 7.5% saline alone (HS) to have similar effects has not been well studied. Removal of the dextran component may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of this solution, which could improve secondary outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) and rates of nosocomial infections.</p>\n<p><u>**Participants **</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Shock:** <strong>There were 893 participants that were randomized (853 enrolled).- TBI:</strong> **There were 1282 participants enrolled and 6-month outcomes data were available for 1087 (85%).\n<u>**Design **</u></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shock:** <strong>Multicenter, randomized, blinded clinical trials involving 114 emergency medical services agencies in North America within the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium were conducted from May 2006 to August 2008.

Although sedation therapy benefits young participants who cannot understand the imperative nature of invasive life-sustaining therapies, sedative use is also associated with untoward adverse effects. Specifically, opioids and benzodiazepines commonly used for pediatric sedation may impair bedside neurological assessment, depress spontaneous ventilation, and prolong mechanical ventilation. Over time, drug tolerance develops, which may precipitate iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome when sedation therapy is no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>Numerous studies in adult critical care support a minimal yet effective approach to sedation management. Sedation goals for mechanically ventilated adults have shifted from an unresponsive state to a calm, easily aroused, readily evaluated participant. Studies in adult participants evaluating targeted sedation, daily interruption and/or titration of sedation, pairing of spontaneous awakening with breathing, and no sedation have reported improved clinical outcomes, including decreased length of mechanical ventilation when compared with usual care.</p>\n<p>In contrast, few data inform sedation practices in pediatric critical care, and international studies describe significant practice variation. Given unique biobehavioral differences, knowledge generated in adult critical care may not translate to the care of critically ill children. The RESTORE study was conducted to test the effect of a nurse-implemented, goal-directed sedation protocol on clinical outcomes in pediatric participants with acute respiratory failure.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Participants</strong></u> There was a total of 2,449 participants (mean age: 4.7 years; range: 2 weeks to 17 years).</p>\n<p><u><strong>Design</strong></u> The RESTORE study was a cluster randomized clinical trial conducted in 31 US PICUs.

Nonetheless, most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation, and VF or VT may persist or recur after shock. There is also evidence that longer durations of VF or VT are associated with decreases in the likelihood of resuscitation. Amiodarone and lidocaine are commonly used to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory VF or VT and prevent recurrences. Previous trials have shown amiodarone to be more effective than placebo or lidocaine for return of spontaneous circulation and survival at hospital admittance. This study sought to further extend the research and examine whether amiodarone would improve survival to hospital discharge and neurologic outcomes, as compared to placebo or lidocaine.</p>\n<p>**Participants **</p>\n<p>3,026 eligible participants were enrolled, with 974 assigned to amiodarone, 993 assigned to lidocaine, and 1,059 assigned to placebo.

Each kit contained three syringes, and each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone, 60 mg of lidocaine, or normal saline. Participants with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols, in compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. If VF or VT persisted or recurred after one or more shocks, eligible participants received a vasopressor and the masked kit containing amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo. Approximating current clinical practice, the initial dose consisted of two syringes administered by rapid bolus. If the estimated body weight of the patient was less than 100 lbs., then one syringe was used. If VF or VT persisted, standard resuscitation measures, additional shocks, and an additional syringe of the study drug were administered.</p>\n<p>At that point the trial interventions were completed and standard interventions for advanced life support were employed. Upon arrival at the hospital, providers were notified of the patient's enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual care in accordance with AHA guidelines, including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but not standardized by the trial protocol. Participants, providers, and trial personnel were blinded to the trial drug assignments, with the exception of treating physicians if emergency un-blinding was required for care.</p>\n<p>Data from pre-hospital patient care records, CPR process measures, and hospital medical records were collected.

As a result, low–tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is now recommended for all patients with ARDS, although penetration of this evidence-based practice has been limited, especially early in mechanical ventilation. LTVV may also benefit patients without ARDS. Consequently, there has been increasing call to apply LTVV for all patients with acute respiratory failure upon initiation of mechanical ventilation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://petalnet.org/\">PETAL Network</a> considered performing a pragmatic stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized, controlled, hybrid implementation trial to examine systematic implementation of a default 6 ml/kg PBW LTVV strategy in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation to improve adherence to LTVV and decrease mortality in acute respiratory failure. Trial planning may be better estimated by simulation than routine, simplistic calculations, but such simulations require detailed data of initial parameters.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> 2848 patients from 49 hospitals were enrolled. Enrollment varied by hospital, ranging from 4 to 100 patients, the maximum enrollment allowed per site.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design:</u></strong> <a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_lotus_fruit/\">PETAL-LOTUS FRUIT</a> was a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation in the PETAL Network hospitals.</p>\n<p>For all patients, baseline demographic data, the hospital location, indication for intubation (hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure or both, altered level of consciousness, or surgery), type of intensive care unit (ICU), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score in the first 24 hours after intubation were collected. Baseline ventilator data immediately after intubation, arterial blood gas results and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry, and presence of ARDS was also collected for all patients. ARDS was defined as a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) less than or equal to 300 with a chest radiograph within 24 hours of the qualifying ratio of arterial oxygen tension to FiO2 that had bilateral infiltrates unexplained by mass, collapse, or effusion. For the first 50 patients enrolled at each hospital, daily data on ventilator mode, Vt, and presence of ARDS for the first 3 days after intubation was collected. Vt indexed to PBW was calculated from the set Vt for patients on ventilator mode with volume settings. For patients on pressure ventilation modes, Vt was calculated from the ratio of minute ventilation (in ml/min) to the respiratory rate. Enrolled patients were followed until hospital discharge or 28 days for clinical outcomes including mortality, ventilator-free days, and length of stay.</p>\n<p>To determine the possible improvement in mortality that could be observed with a reduction in Vt from current usual care in the <a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/petal_lotus_fruit/\">PETAL-LOTUS FRUIT</a> cohort to 6 ml/kg PBW, mortality was estimated as a function of initial Vt.

Specific aims:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to establish whether the results of Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) trials can be generalized to the larger population of participants that experience cardiac arrest;- to more fully establish the burden of cardiac arrest; and - to examine the relationships between variation in EMS structure and process, regional and periodic factors, and participant outcomes.\n**Background: **Cardiac arrest is a common, serious, debilitating and costly public health problem. Although there has been a steady decline in morbidity and mortality from most cardiovascular diseases, high mortality rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests continue to pose a challenge for healthcare providers and a significant public health burden. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was established in 2004 to conduct clinical research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury with the overall goal of improving resuscitation outcomes. Participant and care characteristics can predict favorable outcomes in cardiac arrests, but there is still a wide variation in outcomes that is not well understood. EMS factors such as service level, number of responding providers, use of procedures or drugs in the field, training, quality assurance/feedback, and response time intervals also vary significantly by region. Variations in geographic, socioeconomic and periodic factors may also be associated with differences in outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prior to ROC Cardiac Epistry, there were no North American population-based registries for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Therefore there was a need for standardized data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in diverse geographic locations in order to identify the independent effects of prognostic or treatment factors accounting for variations in survival.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **The registry included 109,326 cardiac arrest events from 264 EMS agencies transporting to 287 acute care hospitals from the following regional centers: Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas, Texas; Iowa City, Iowa; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; San Diego, California; Seattle/King County, Washington; Ottawa, Ontario; Toronto, Ontario; and Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>\n<p>**Design: **ROC Epistry collected standardized data regarding episode-specific factors, participant demographics, clinical information, pre-hospital interventions and disposition, hospital information, and participant outcome for all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the ROC regions. Each ROC site had to ensure capture of all eligible cases within the EMS service areas. Out-of-hospital data were extracted from existing databases whenever possible and augmented with targeted review of EMS reports. Hospital data were abstracted directly from the hospital file in most cases. Alternative methods included linkage to death registries and obituaries if the death occurred within 30 days. Sites submitted data using a web-based interface or batch uploads. Participants were not contacted directly.</p>",

However, there are no proven effective medical treatments for this syndrome. Evidence suggests that impairments in nitric oxide availability have a potentially important role in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p>\n<p>Unlike organic nitrates, inorganic nitrite is converted to nitric oxide in the presence of hypoxia and acidosis, conditions that develop during exercise. Because the cardiac, vascular, and skeletal muscle abnormalities that limit physical capacity and contribute to symptoms in patients with HFpEF characteristically develop during exercise, inorganic nitrite may provide the best way to target nitric oxide delivery precisely at the time of greatest need. The HFN-INDIE trial was initiated to test the hypothesis that compared to placebo, longer-term use of inhaled, nebulized inorganic nitrite would enhance peak exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong>:** **A total of 105 participants were randomized. 53 were randomized to receive nitrite first and 52 were randomized to receive placebo first.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>:** **HFN-INDIE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After enrollment, patients underwent baseline studies to determine eligibility. All patients were required to display objective exercise limitation, evidenced by reduced peak oxygen consumption (V̇o<sub>2</sub>) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing of less than 75% predicted, with a respiratory exchange ratio indicative of maximal effort (≥1.0). Following qualifying exercise testing, eligible participants received an open-label, single-dose run-in of inhaled, nebulized sodium nitrite (80 mg) to assess tolerability, symptoms, and orthostatic vital signs. Patients developing hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x3C;90 mm Hg seated or standing), light-headedness, or any other intolerance were categorized as a run-in failure and were not randomized. Following the baseline studies, eligible patients were randomly assigned to either receive nitrite first or to receive placebo first. Study drug was administered 3 times a day by nebulizer. During each 6-week period, patients were instructed to take no study drug for the first 2 weeks (baseline phase during the first period and washout phase during the second period), followed by 46 mg 3 times daily for 1 week, and then 80 mg 3 times daily for 3 weeks. After the first period, patients returned to the study center to receive the crossover study drug.</p>\n<p>The prespecified primary end point was peak V̇o<sub>2</sub>, measured as the highest 30-second average during upright cycle ergometry, during the 4-week period in which patients were receiving inorganic nitrite as compared with placebo. Accelerometry, health-related quality-of-life scores on the self-administered Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (score range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), echocardiographic indicators of cardiac filling pressures measured at trough drug levels (E/e′ ratio, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left atrial volume index; lower scores indicate better health for all), ventilatory efficiency (VE/V̇co<sub>2</sub>, lower indicating better health), exercise time (higher indicating better health), and NT-proBNP levels (lower indicating better health) were also collected.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Availability:</strong> Data available from this study includes transthoracic echocardiogram images from multiple timepoints.

The majority of seriously injured persons are initially evaluated and cared for by prehospital providers, however the effect of EMS systems, EMS clinical care, and EMS interventions on trauma patient outcomes is largely unknown. EMS factors such as service level, number of responding providers, use of procedures or drugs in the field, training, quality assurance/feedback, and response time intervals also vary significantly by region.</p>\n<p>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was established in 2004 to conduct clinical research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and life-threatening traumatic injury with the overall goal of improving resuscitation outcomes. Previous trauma registries have generally focused primarily on hospitalized patients with limited prehospital information. Registries may also exclude trauma cases at far ends of the spectrum, such as those who die in the field or in a non-trauma center and/or patients that are treated and released. These limitations do not allow for detailed, outcome-based assessments of EMS system factors necessary to define prehospital resuscitation best practices.

However, performance of CPR is highly variable both outside hospital and in hospital. Interruptions in chest compression, inadequate depth of chest compression, and high rates of ventilation adversely affect blood flow during chest compressions and can hinder resuscitation. Suboptimal CPR, particularly time spent without chest compressions (low chest compression fraction), can reduce survival of cardiac arrest patients.</p>\n<p>Current technology incorporated into a monitor-defibrillator can assess core components of CPR through the use of an accelerometer and impedance changes across the defibrillation electrodes. This technology can also provide real-time audiovisual feedback so that the rescuer is prompted to perform according to guideline specifications. Use of such feedback increases the likelihood of performing CPR in accordance with guidelines during training and simulation.</p>\n<p><u>Participants</u>:** **There were 1586 participants: 771 treated without feedback and 815 with feedback.</p>\n<p><u>Design</u>: CPR feedback was provided through proprietary Q-CPR software operating in the Philips MRx monitor-defibrillator. The feedback feature of the defibrillator includes audible voice prompts and visual messages on the monitor screen that are triggered when measured chest compressions or ventilation deviate from guidelines or are interrupted.</p>\n<p>The study was conducted in 21 emergency medical service (EMS) agencies at three ROC regions in the U.S. and Canada. Randomized treatment clusters, which ranged from individual emergency medical vehicles to groups of emergency agencies, were assigned to feedback-on or feedback-off treatments. Each cluster remained in its assigned mode for two to seven months, after which it switched to the opposite treatment arm. At the end of those two treatment periods, each cluster was again randomly assigned to feedback-on or feedback-off. This cycle continued for the duration of the study. Each cluster switched treatment arms at least once, and up to four times, during the study.</p>\n<p><u>Conclusions</u>: Real-time visual and audible feedback during CPR altered performance to more closely conform with CPR guidelines. Clusters assigned to feedback were associated with increased proportion of time in which chest compressions were provided, increased compression depth, and decreased proportion of compressions with incomplete release. However, frequency of prehospital return of spontaneous circulation did not differ according to feedback status, nor did the presence of a pulse at hospital arrival, survival to discharge, or awake at hospital discharge (Hostler, et al., 2011, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21296838/\">21296838</a>).</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Objectives</strong>: The clinical trial assessed the safety and efficacy of three interventions. Specifically, it evaluated (1) the major health benefits and risks of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone, (2) the effects of a low-fat eating pattern on risk of colorectal cancer, and (3) the efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures. The objective of the memory study was to determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects global cognitive function, and evaluate the therapy's effect on the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p>The observational study is examining the relationship between lifestyle, socioeconomic, health, and other risk factors with cardiovascular, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fracture outcomes. Secondary objectives include providing more reliable estimates of the extent to which known risk factors predict disease, more precise estimates of new occurrences of disease, and to provide a future resource for the identification of new or novel risk factors especially factors found in blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000200\">The Women's Health Initiative (WHI)</a> is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing the major causes of death, disability, and frailty in postmenopausal women, specifically heart disease, cancer, and osteoporotic fractures. The WHI is primarily composed of an observational study (OS), as well a clinical trial (CT) with three components: Hormone Replacement Therapy (HT), Dietary Modification, (DM) and Calcium/Vitamin D supplementation (CaD).</p>\n<p>Prior to the WHI, observational studies suggested that postmenopausal hormone therapy was associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Potential cardioprotection was based on generally supportive data on lipid levels in intermediate outcome clinical trials, trials in nonhuman primates, and a large body of observational studies suggesting a 40% to 50% reduction in risk among users of either estrogen alone or, less frequently, combined estrogen and progestin. Observational studies primarily examining unopposed estrogen preparations have suggested a 30% to 50% reduction in coronary events, and an 8% to 30% increase in breast cancer with extended use. Other research findings indicated that hormone therapy was also associated with a decreased risk of osteoporosis and increased bone density. The WHI HT trials were designed to test the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on risk for coronary heart disease and assess overall risks and benefits in predominantly healthy women.</p>\n<p>The Women's Health Initiative Memory Program (WHIMS) consists of a suite of studies which include cohorts of women who participated in the WHI HT trials. Postmenopausal women have a greater risk than men of developing Alzheimer's disease, but studies of the effects of estrogen therapy on Alzheimer's disease have been inconsistent. Additionally, observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone treatment may improve cognitive function, but data from randomized clinical trials have been sparse and inconclusive.</p>\n<p>International comparisons and migration studies have suggested that countries with 50% lower fat intake than the US population had approximately one third the risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, fairly consistent evidence existed for an effect of dietary fat, vegetables and fruits, and grains on colorectal cancer risk from within-country observational studies, although the protective effect of lower fat intake was no longer clear after adjusting for energy intake. The WHI DM trial was the first randomized trial to directly address the health effects of a low-fat eating pattern in predominantly healthy postmenopausal women from diverse racial/ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Osteoporosis is a major cause of injury, loss of independence, and death, and contributes to hip fractures. Observational evidence and data from previous randomized clinical trials suggest that calcium and/or vitamin D supplements may slow bone loss and reduce the risk of falls in postmenopausal and elderly women. However, evidence from trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with respect to hip and other fractures was limited at the time the WHI was initiated. In two prior randomized trials, calcium plus vitamin D supplements did not reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures among older women. When the WHI CaD trial was designed, guidelines recommended daily intakes of 800 to 1200 mg of calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D for the prevention of osteoporosis, which was not met by many American women. Therefore, the WHI CaD trial was designed to test the primary hypothesis that postmenopausal women randomly assigned to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation would have a lower risk of hip fracture and, secondarily, of all fractures than women assigned to placebo.</p>\n<p><strong>Subjects</strong>: Postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79 were eligible to participate. A woman was considered postmenopausal if she had experienced no vaginal bleeding for 6 months (12 months for women under 55 years of age), had had a hysterectomy, or had ever used postmenopausal hormones. Recruitment was carried out in 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. The clinical trial components had additional specific inclusion or exclusion criteria.</p>\n<p>A total of 68,132 women were randomized into at least one component of the clinical trial. 27,347 women were enrolled in the hormone therapy component with 16,608 in the estrogen plus progestin trial and 10,739 in the unopposed estrogen trial, 48,835 women were enrolled in the diet modification component, and 36,282 women were enrolled in the calcium/vitamin D component. 7,479 women 65 years of age and older at baseline and that participated in the HT trial component were enrolled in the ancillary memory study.</p>\n<p>Women who were either ineligible or unwilling to participate in the clinical trial component were enrolled in the observational study. For example, many potential participants to the clinical trial component of the study were already undertaking a low fat diet or were using hormone replacement therapy. The effect of the selection process was that women enrolled in the observational study tended to have healthier lifestyles compared to those enrolled in the clinical trial. In total, 93,676 subjects were enrolled in WHI OS, with over 16% being members of a racial/ethnic minority group.</p>\n<p>The first WHI Extension Study enrolled 115,407 consenting participants from all components of the original WHI study for an additional five years of follow-up, from 2005 to 2010. In 2010, 93,567 women consented to continued follow-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: The clinical trial component of the WHI included three randomized comparisons: hormone therapy, dietary modification, and calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Women could have been randomized into one, two or all three trials.</p>\n<p>The hormone therapy trial enrolled women to one of two double-blinded trials: estrogen (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens daily) plus progestin (2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily) or estrogen alone. Women with a prior hysterectomy were eligible for the trial of unopposed estrogen. Women with an intact uterus at screening were initially also eligible for unopposed estrogen, but were reassigned to the trial of combined postmenopausal hormones beginning in 1995. Both trials randomized participants 1:1 to either hormone therapy or placebo. A 3-month washout period was required before baseline evaluation of women using postmenopausal hormones at initial screening. Study participants were contacted by telephone 6 weeks after randomization to assess symptoms and reinforce adherence. Follow-up contacts by telephone or clinic visit occurred every 6 months, with clinic visits required annually.</p>\n<p>The estrogen plus progestin trial was halted in July 2002 after a mean 5.2 years of follow-up because health risks, including increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, exceeded benefits. The estrogen alone trial was stopped early in March 2004, because an increased risk of stroke was found with no benefit for coronary heart disease. The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome.</p>\n<p>The dietary modification trial evaluated the effect of a low-fat, high fruit, vegetable, and grain diet on preventing cardiovascular disease and cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or a comparison group in the ratio of 2:3 for cost-efficiency. The intervention was an intensive behavioral modification program, using 18 group sessions in the first year and quarterly sessions thereafter, led by specially trained and certified nutritionists. The program was designed to promote dietary change with the goals of reducing total fat to 20% of energy intake, increasing vegetables and fruits to at least 5 servings daily and grains to at least 6 servings daily. The intervention did not include total energy reduction or weight loss goals. Comparison group participants received a copy of the US Department of Health and Human Services' Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other health-related materials but were not asked to make dietary changes. Dietary intake was monitored using the WHI food frequency questionnaire at 1 year and in a rotating one-third subsample every year thereafter. Women completed a medical update questionnaire every 6 months, and medical records were sought for all women reporting colorectal cancer. The primary outcome was invasive colorectal cancer incidence.</p>\n<p>Participants in the calcium/vitamin D trial were randomized 1:1 to either supplements or placebo. Active tablets contained 500 mg of elemental calcium (as calcium carbonate) and 200 IU of vitamin D3, to be taken twice daily with meals. The presence and severity of symptoms, safety concerns, and outcomes were ascertained at annual clinic visits and telephone or clinic visits at intervening six-month intervals. Risk factors for fracture were assessed by questionnaire, interview, and clinical examination. The primary outcome was incidence of hip fracture.</p>\n<p>Participants in the observational study attended a baseline examination and were re-examined three years later. Participants completed annual updates of exposures and clinical outcomes by mail. Final data were collected by mail during the close-out period in April 2004 to March 2005. The major clinical outcomes of interest were coronary heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, osteoporotic fractures, diabetes, and total mortality. Most outcomes were initially ascertained by self-report on an annual questionnaire and documented by hospital and related records. Charts with potential cardiovascular, cancer, and fracture outcomes were sent to the local physician adjudicator for evaluation and classification. Staff at the Clinical Coordinating Center coded and adjudicated all cancers of major interest in the study using standardized SEER guidelines.</p>\n<p>In 2005, WHI participants were invited to join the Extension Study for an additional five years of follow-up in order to collect long-term outcomes. Participants completed annual data collection forms primarily by mail, similar to the OS follow-up. Women reporting study outcomes were contacted by WHI field center staff to obtain additional details and medical records, which were evaluated by physician adjudicators. In 2010, the woman remaining were invited to join the next Extension Study. In the second extension, women were divided into two groups, one of which would have outcomes documented with medical records (the Medical Records Cohort, MRC), and the other would just be followed by self-report (the Self-Report Cohort, SRC). The MRC consists of women who were in the hormone therapy trials, and all African-American and Hispanic women. In 2012-2013, a subset of the MRC was identified for a potential in-home visit to collect blood and several objective measures of physical functioning.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin after an average 5.2 year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women (Rossouw et al., 2002, PMID:<a href=\"http://12117397\">12117397</a>). Among postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older, estrogen plus progestin did not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo (Rapp et al., 2003, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12771113/\">12771113</a>), increased the risk for probable dementia, and did not prevent mild cognitive impairment (Shumaker, et al., 2003, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12771112/\">12771112</a>). The use of conjugated equine estrogen increased the risk of stroke, decreased the risk of hip fracture, and did not affect CHD incidence in postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy after an average of 6.8 years of follow-up (Anderson et al., 2004, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15082697/\">15082697</a>). Over approximately 8 years of follow-up, a low-fat dietary pattern did not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (Beresford, et al., PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16467233/\">16467233</a>). Calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density; however, no significant difference was observed in hip fractures (Jackson, et al., 2006, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16481635/\">16481635</a>). A recent review summarizes the conclusions from the WHI clinical trials with a focus on clinical practice (Manson, et al., 2024, PMID: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38691368/\">38691368</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Description of ECG Imaging Data</strong>: Electric cardiograms (ECGs) were given to all clinical trial participants at baseline and in years 3, 6, and 9 of the original WHI study.</p>\n<p>EKG data consist of 12 lead 10 seconds ECGS sampled at 500Hz via GE ECG machines and process via GE MUSE system. The ECG waveform were directly exported from GE MUSE using MUSE export function in XML format, which include EKG waveform data as well as other ECG characteristics.</p>\n<p>Waveform data is in base64 encoded format, when it is decoded, it is a binary data that can be used to draw waveform graph.</p>\n<p>Many programming languages and data tools have built in functions to decode base64 strings.</p>\n<p>All the other necessary information is included in the LeadData section, total byte size, total sample size etc. (usually 1 sample is 2 bytes). See example below:</p>\n<p>encoded-data (base64 encoded string)</p>\n<p>JwAoAC0AKAAiACIAJAAkACQAIwAiACIAHgAcABwAGwAZABgAGAAYABcAEwAQABAAEAAL^/AAsADAAM...</p>\n<p>decoded-binary-data (1 sample is 2 bytes)</p>\n<p>270028002D002800220022002400240024002300220022001E001C001C001B00</p>\n<p>1900180018001800170013001000100010000B000B000C000C000D000D000D00</p>\n<p>0A000A000A0009000600040004000700070005000500020...</p>\n<p>These binary values are integers (Y axis data of the graph), hence it is a straightforward process to draw the waveform graph.</p>\n<p>Acquisition dates have been redacted from this ECG data to comply with WHI policy.

The data from this accession is not available for download through dbGaP.</p>\n<p>**Objective: **The purpose of this study was to examine two different treatments during a cardiac arrest that occurs outside of the hospital and whether either or both treatments would increase the number of people who lived to hospital discharge with satisfactory functional status. The first treatment involved using a device called the Impedance Threshold Device (ITD). The other treatment involved the amount of CPR given before the emergency medical services (EMS) providers first looked at the heart rhythm to determine if a shock is needed.</p>\n<p>**Background: **Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a common and lethal problem with a low survival rate, leading to an estimated 330,000 deaths each year in the United States and Canada. The traditional approach to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has been to emphasize early analysis of cardiac rhythm, with delivery of defibrillatory shocks, if indicated, as quickly as possible. It has been suggested, however, that many participants may benefit from a period of CPR before the first analysis of rhythm.</p>\n<p>The impedance threshold device (ITD) is designed to enhance venous return and cardiac output during CPR by increasing the degree of negative intrathoracic pressure. Previous studies have suggested that the use of an ITD during CPR may improve survival rates after cardiac arrest. This effect is achieved by preventing the passive inflow of air into the chest during chest recoil between chest compressions without impeding active ventilation. The ITD has been found to improve hemodynamics, the perfusion of vital organs, and neurologically intact survival in studies in animals. The results of small, short-term clinical trials have suggested that the ITD can increase systolic blood pressure during resuscitation and improve short-term survival rates.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **In the ITD study, 4,345 participants were assigned to sham ITD and 4,373 to active ITD, while in the early versus later rhythm analysis, 5,290 participants were assigned to early cardiac rhythm analysis, and 4,643 were assigned to later cardiac rhythm analysis. This study qualified for exception from informed consent required for emergency research.</p>\n<p>**Design: **Most participants were enrolled simultaneously in both the early analysis versus later analysis component and the active ITD versus sham ITD component of the trial.</p>\n<p>The use of an active ITD was compared with that of a sham ITD in participants at 10 ROC sites in the United States and Canada. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, and all care providers were unaware of the treatment assignments. EMS personnel were trained in ITD function, proper use of the ITD, and all aspects of protocol implementation, with an emphasis on the optimal performance of CPR according to local guidelines. The first EMS responders to arrive at the scene of the arrest who were equipped with a randomly assigned ITD (active or sham) attached the device between the ventilation bag and face mask or between the bag and an advanced airway. Responders were encouraged to implement use of the device within 5 minutes after their arrival or as soon as clinically possible.</p>\n<p>Each of the 10 participating ROC centers was also divided into approximately 20 clusters. All episodes of cardiac arrest in a cluster were randomly assigned to one CPR strategy; after a set period of time, ranging from 3 to 12 months, all episodes in that cluster were then assigned to the other strategy. Participants in the early-analysis group were assigned to receive 30 to 60 seconds of chest compressions and ventilations (sufficient time to place defibrillator electrodes) before electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis, and those in the late-analysis group were assigned to receive 3 minutes of chest compressions and ventilations before ECG analysis. The start and stop times for CPR were recorded by the responders, and the information was supplemented by the recording of defibrillator time.</p>\n<p>**Conclusions: **All 10 sites halted enrollment in November 2009 when the data and safety monitoring board recommended termination because interim analysis showed that the findings were not likely to change with continuation of the study. Neither use of the ITD nor the amount of CPR given before cardiac rhythm analysis significantly improved survival with satisfactory function (i.e., a score of ≤3 on the modified Rankin scale) among participants with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving standard CPR. There were also no significant differences in the secondary outcomes, including rates of return of spontaneous circulation on arrival at the emergency department, survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge.</p>",

The data from this accession is not available for download through dbGaP.</p>\n<p>**Objective: **To observe if patients with severe traumatic injuries evacuated to level 1 trauma centers on air ambulances who received prehospital red blood cells and/or plasma had decreased in-hospital mortality compared to patients who received only crystalloids.</p>\n<p>**Background: **Injury is the leading cause of death in adults and children between the ages of 1 and 44 years. However, approximately 40% of in-hospital deaths among injured patients involve massive truncal hemorrhage that is considered potentially salvageable. Multiple retrospective military and civilian studies have reported that transfusion involving blood component ratios approaching whole blood are associated with significant decreases in 24-hour and 30-day mortality among injured patients. Furthermore, prehospital transfusion (PHT) studies from military and civilian hospitals have shown that prehospital transfusion of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) is not only feasible, but associated with improved coagulation status on arrival. Prehospital resuscitation practices in the US differ significantly in approach, with most systems using crystalloids while a few offer RBCs or a combination of plasma and RBCs. No large multicenter civilian studies have evaluated the use of prehospital plasma and RBCs in severely injured patients compared to crystalloids.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **A total of 25,118 trauma patients were admitted during the 10 month enrollment period to the nine participating centers, of which 2341 arrived by helicopter, and 1058 met the highest risk criteria. Of the high risk sub-set, 585 arrived on helicopters with blood products available and 473 patients arrived via helicopters without blood available. One hundred forty two patients (24%) of those transported on helicopters with blood products available actually received PHT and 916 patients did not.</p>\n<p>**Design: **PROHS was a multicenter, prospective pragmatic, observational study of prehospital resuscitation approaches. There were no study guidelines dictating resuscitation practice (i.e., use of blood products or end of resuscitation). Of the 9 participating Level I trauma centers, 5 had helicopter systems with plasma and/or RBCs while the other 4 had helicopter systems that used only crystalloid resuscitation. All patients arriving to the participating center's trauma emergency department via helicopter directly from the scene were screened and had initial data collected. Of that group, all patients who met the highest risk category or received blood during transport were followed by direct observation during the initial resuscitation period and then indirectly through medical chart review until hospital discharge or 30 days after admission (whichever occurred first).</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality at 3 hours, 24 hours, and 30 days. Other outcome measures included length of hospital stay, number of ICU days, number of ventilator days, blood product usage, GOSE score at discharge, number of patients with complications, and number of patients who required hemostatic devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the unexpected imbalance in injury severity between systems with and without blood products on helicopters, all analyses were inconclusive. With few units transfused to each patient and small outcome differences between groups, large randomized studies will be required to detect significant survival differences in this important population.</p>",

A portion of those individuals develop chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI is associated with severe health outcomes. CLTI is defined by ischemic foot pain at rest, ischemic ulcerations, or gangrene. Treatment for CLTI includes revascularization to improve limb perfusion and limit the risk of amputation. However, the choice of surgery or endovascular therapy for revascularization varies greatly. The extent to which this variability affects clinical outcomes in patients with CLTI is unknown.</p>\n<p>The BEST-CLI trial was initiated to determine whether endovascular revascularization was superior to surgical revascularization in patients with CLTI.</p>\n<p>**Participants **</p>\n<p>A total of 1434 participants with a single segment of great saphenous vein comprised cohort 1. Of these, 718 participants were randomly assigned to the surgical treatment group and 716 participants were randomly assigned to the endovascular therapy group. A total of 396 participants needing an alternative conduit comprised cohort 2. Of these, 197 participants were randomly assigned to the surgical treatment group and 199 participants were randomly assigned to the endovascular therapy group.</p>\n<p>**Design **</p>\n<p>BEST-CLI was an international, randomized, open-label trial.

Survival to hospital discharge of participants with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was the main outcome measure. Survival was compared in community units (e.g., apartment or office buildings, gated communities, sports venues, senior centers, shopping malls) served by non-medical responders trained in CPR and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), to units receiving the traditional optimum community standard of care (i.e., rescuers trained to recognize a cardiac emergency, call 911, and initiate CPR).</p>\n<p>**Background **</p>\n<p>Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) remains a significant cause of death, in spite of recent declines in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease. Existing methods of emergency resuscitation are inadequate due to time delays inherent in transporting trained responders with defibrillation capabilities to the side of the OOH-CA victim.</p>\n<p>Existing Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems typically combine paramedic Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) services with some level of community involvement, such as bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. Some communities include automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at isolated sites or in mobile police or fire vehicles. Such an approach typically varies in effectiveness, with an incremental improvement in effectiveness seen in communities that organize and integrate services with the existing EMS system. However, optimal improvement in survival from sudden OOH-CA may require a program that utilizes volunteer non-medical responders (who may not have a traditional duty to respond to an emergency) trained to use AEDs.</p>\n<p>**Participants **</p>\n<p>The PAD trial was a prospective, randomized community based trial. More than 19,000 volunteer responders from 993 community units in 24 North American regions participated. The two study arms had similar unit and volunteer characteristics. Participants with treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the two groups were similar in age (mean: 69.8 years), proportion of men (67 perecnt), rate of cardiac arrest in a public location (70 percent), and rate of witnessed cardiac arrest (72 percent).</p>\n<p>**Conclusions **</p>\n<p>Community units with volunteers trained in CPR and AEDs had significantly more participants surviving to hospital discharge than units with volunteers trained to use CPR only. There were 30 survivors among 128 definite cardiac arrests in the CPR+AED units and 15 survivors among 107 definite cardiac arrests in the CPR only units (p = 0.03). Serious adverse effects were rarely reported. No volunteers received inadvertent shocks, and no participants were shocked unnecessarily. AED maintenance problems were infrequent. A few participating volunteers reported severe stress related to responding to emergency situations. Although residential complexes represented 16% of the units and 29% of the treatable cardiac arrests, only 5% of the survivors were from residential complexes. Such information should be helpful for individual facilities that are considering implementing PAD programs. (NEJM 2004; 351:637-46).</p>",

A large, multicenter trial conducted a decade before this study reported that the early administration of a 48-hour infusion of neuromuscular blockade in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen [Pao2] to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2] of &#x3C;150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥5 cm of water) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine neuromuscular blockade. Despite these encouraging results, early neuromuscular blockade has not been widely adopted. Potential concerns include the lack of research comparing neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation with current practice (which promotes lighter sedation targets) as well as limited data on the effect of neuromuscular blockade on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes. Therefore, the PETAL-ROSE study was initiated to determine the efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade with concomitant heavy sedation as compared with a strategy of usual care with lighter sedation targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong>: There were 1006 participants.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>:** **PETAL-ROSE was a multicenter, unblinded, randomized trial of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 48 hours of continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to receive usual care without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group).</p>\n<p>Patients in the intervention group who were not under deep sedation at baseline were deeply sedated within 4 hours after randomization. Subsequently, patients in this group received an intravenous bolus of 15 mg of cisatracurium, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. After the 48-hour trial intervention period, decisions regarding further use of neuromuscular blockade, including the choice of agent, were left to the discretion of the treating clinician. Neuromuscular blockade could be stopped early if the patient met the criteria for freedom from mechanical ventilation (Fio2 ≤0.40 and PEEP ≤8 cm of water) for at least 12 hours.</p>\n<p>All patients were treated with a strategy of low tidal volume ventilation within 2 hours after randomization and a high PEEP strategy for up to 5 days after randomization.

BPD affects infants born prematurely, is a major contributor to the cost of prematurity each year, and is associated with long-term pulmonary disability, neurodevelopmental abnormalities and death.</p>\n<p>Increases in the survival of ELGAN infants have resulted in another form of BPD, which is characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular development with excess tone and reactivity of airway smooth muscle.</p>\n<p>Despite treatments to enhance lung maturation, premature infants often need prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation and/or oxygen support. When mechanical ventilation is required longer than 7 days, BPD results in 70% of surviving ELGAN infants. Most of these infants experience clinical episodes of increased requirement for ventilatory support that are associated with dysfunctional surfactant, which is primarily due to low surfactant protein B (SP-B). In pilot studies of late surfactant treatment in premature infants, there was short-term improvement in SP-B content. These prior studies provided the rationale for a larger clinical trial for later doses of surfactant treatment to prevent episodes of respiratory decompensation and BPD.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> 511 infants were eligible for randomization of the 2693 infants screened. Of the 511 infants eligible for randomization, there were 252 infants allocated to the treatment arm and 259 infants allocated to the placebo arm.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design:</u></strong> The study was designed to assess the effect of late doses of surfactant on survival without BPD at 36 weeks post menstrual age (PMA) in ELGAN infants who required intubation and mechanical ventilation between 7 and 14 days of age and were receiving Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Infants were stratified within clinical centers and gestational age groups and randomized to treatment with calfactant, a natural surfactant extracted from bovine lung lavage fluid, or a sham procedure.</p>\n<p>All infants received iNO according to the protocol used in the Nitric Oxide Chronic Lung Disease (NOCLD) trial. A masked syringe containing either a standard dose of calfactant for the treatment group, or air for the placebo group, was administered to the infant behind a screen by staff not involved in providing the infant's clinical care. Monitor and ventilator alarms were turned off during dosing to avoid unblinding of clinical staff. To accommodate research staff availability and infant instability, the dosing interval was not strictly set but could be repeated every 24 – 72 hours up to 5 doses if the infant still required intubation. Dosing could be discontinued by physician request or parental withdrawal from the study. Due to parental preference, the first infant in a multiple birth was randomized according to the randomization schedule and subsequent infants were assigned to the same treatment group. Follow-up to assess pulmonary and neurologic development continued until 2 years of age, with treatment group blinding maintained.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was survival without BPD at 36 weeks PMA. Secondary outcomes included BPD at 40 weeks PMA, pulmonary outcome at 12–24 months of age, and neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions:</u></strong> There were no significant differences observed between the treatment group and the control group for survival without BPD at 36 weeks or 40 weeks.</p>",

The majority of sepsis participants experience elevated circulating cell-free hemoglobin levels, which is associated with development of organ dysfunction including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.</p>\n<p>Acetaminophen has been found in observational studies to be associated with improved survival in critically ill sepsis participants with elevated plasma cell-free hemoglobin, and small clinical trials have had positive sepsis participant outcomes such as reduced plasma biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and improved kidney function. However, a large, randomized trial of acetaminophen administration for treatment of fever in participants with suspected infection did not show a mortality benefit. The NHLBI PETAL Network initiated ASTER as a larger phase trial to examine the utility of plasma cell-free hemoglobin level as a biomarker for future sepsis trials and whether acetaminophen would increase the number of days alive and free of organ support for participants with sepsis and respiratory or circulatory organ dysfunction.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **A total of 447 participants were enrolled and randomized, 227 to the acetaminophen arm and 220 to the placebo arm. Data from 40 participants who were randomized to the Vitamin C arm, which was stopped early (see Design section below), is also included.</p>\n<p>**Design: **ASTER was a phase 2b multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial. The study originally had a 3-arm platform trial in which participants were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with intravenous acetaminophen, vitamin C, or a common placebo. The vitamin C arm of the trial was stopped after enrolling 79 participants due to external clinical trial data for vitamin C.</p>\n<p>Participants randomized to the acetaminophen arm received acetaminophen at the dose of 1 g in 100 mL diluent (or 15 mg/kg if actual body weight was &#x3C;50 kg) every 6 hours intravenously for 5 days for a total of 20 doses. Participants randomized to placebo received an identical appearing intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 5% dextrose in water every 6 hours for 5 days. In both arms, the study drug was discontinued prior to 120 hours, if one of the following occurred, (1) discharge from the study hospital, (2) discharge from the ICU, (3) withdrawal from the study, or (4) death. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were monitored on study day 0, and days 2 through 5 . New measured values of AST or ALT greater than or equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal on any measurement prompted permanent discontinuation of the study drug. The primary efficacy variable was days alive and free of any organ support (dialysis, assisted ventilation, and vasopressors) out to day 28.</p>\n<p>**Conclusions: **Intravenous acetaminophen was considered to be safe but did not significantly improve days alive and free of organ support in critically ill sepsis participants. There was no significant interaction between cell-free hemoglobin levels and acetaminophen.</p>",

Chest compressions during standard CPR are interrupted frequently by ventilations. These interruptions reduce blood flow and potentially reduce the effectiveness of CPR. In animals with cardiac arrest, the interruption of chest compressions has been associated with decreased survival. Observational studies involving humans with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause have suggested that continuous compressions are associated with higher rates of survival than interrupted compressions.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **Of 35,904 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were screened, 26,148 were eligible for participation in the trial and were enrolled in the trial during either the run-in phase or the active-enrollment phase. The active-enrollment phase included 23,711 patients, of whom 12,653 were assigned to the intervention group and 11,058 to the control group.</p>\n<p>**Design: **There were 114 participating EMS agencies across the eight participating Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) sites, which were grouped into 47 clusters. Clusters of agencies were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to perform continuous chest compressions or interrupted chest compressions during all the out-of-hospital cardiac arrests to which they responded. Each cluster was required to begin enrolling patients in a run-in phase to demonstrate adherence to the protocol before entering the active-enrollment phase of the trial. Twice per year, each cluster was crossed over to the other resuscitation strategy.</p>\n<p>Patients assigned to the group that received continuous chest compressions (intervention group) were to receive continuous chest compressions at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, with asynchronous positive-pressure ventilations delivered at a rate of 10 ventilations per minute. Patients assigned to the group that received interrupted chest compressions (control group) were to receive compressions that were interrupted for ventilations at a ratio of 30 compressions to two ventilations; ventilations were to be given with positive pressure during a pause in compressions of less than 5 seconds in duration.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was the rate of survival to hospital discharge.

Emergency medical services (EMS) paramedics commonly perform ETI or insertion of supraglottic airways (SGAs), such as the LT, on patients with OHCA to facilitate oxygenation and protect the lungs from aspiration of vomitus. Because SGA insertion is rapid, simple, and requires less training compared to ETI, many EMS agencies have incorporated this as the primary method of ventilation during OHCA resuscitation. However, the optimal method for OHCA advanced airway management is unknown.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **A total of 3004 patients were included; 1505 assigned to initial LT and 1499 assigned to initial ETI.</p>\n<p>**Design: **PART was a multicenter cluster-crossover randomized trial. The trial included 27 EMS agencies associated with US sites of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). The EMS agencies were grouped into 13 randomization clusters. Each cluster selected a crossover interval of 3 or 5 months. Within each cluster, treatment assignments for consecutive intervals were computer-randomized in blocks of 2 to ensure balanced exposure to both airway groups. Crossovers between study groups could occur more than once. Treatment assignments were initial LT insertion or initial ETI. Neuromuscular blocking agents or video laryngoscopy was permitted for initial intubation efforts. The trial did not limit the number of initial LT insertion or ETI attempts. If the initial insertion efforts were unsuccessful, EMS personnel performed rescue airway management using any available airway technique. EMS personnel followed local protocols for confirmation of airway placement and management of OHCA, including field termination of resuscitation efforts. Patients receiving bag-valve mask (BVM) ventilation only were retained in their assigned treatment group per intention-to-treat principles. The trial did not prescribe clinical care at the receiving hospitals, including use of EMS airway, targeted temperature management, percutaneous coronary intervention, or the timing of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was 72-hour survival. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital discharge, and favorable neurological status at hospital discharge (Modified Rankin Scale score ≤3).</p>\n<p>**Conclusions: **Among adults with OHCA, a strategy of initial LT insertion was associated with significantly greater 72-hour survival compared with a strategy of initial ETI. These findings suggest that LT insertion may be considered as an initial airway management strategy in patients with OHCA, but limitations of the pragmatic design, practice setting, and ETI performance characteristics suggest that further research is warranted.</p>",

Biospecimens from LTRC include DNA, Plasma, Serum, Tissue - FFPE Cassettes, Tissue – RNALater Frozen, and Tissue - Snap Frozen. Please note that use of biospecimens in genetic research is subject to a tiered consent.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Objectives:</u></strong> The LTRC was a biobank resource established by the NHLBI to collect and distribute lung tissue, blood samples, clinical data, and radiographic studies from participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other related idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) and interstitial pneumonias associated with connective tissue diseases who undergo medically-indicated lung resection. All tissue and blood specimens and clinical data were banked centrally and stored for distribution to external investigators who have approved study proposals to investigate the pathogenesis or management of lung diseases. The ultimate goal of this program was to enable research that illuminates the pathobiology of lung diseases and leads to novel interventional treatments for these conditions.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong> Chronic lung diseases are a main cause of death and disability in the United States. COPD affects over 14 million individuals in the United States and represents the third leading cause of mortality. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor. However, only one of six individuals who smoke develops COPD. This could imply either an individual susceptibility or an additional immunologic or infectious injury to lung cells. Current treatments offer symptomatic relief, but do not prevent disease progression. Better understanding of disease pathogenesis, including the potential roles of lung parenchymal cell apoptosis, immunologic injury, and inflammation may lead to therapies that improve survival and quality of life.</p>\n<p>Interstitial pneumonias, including IPF and those associated with connective tissue disease, are less common than COPD, but for many of these diseases there are poor outcomes. For example, IPF has a 50% survival rate 2-3 years following diagnosis, and currently no treatment exists which prolongs survival. The prevalence of IPF is approximately 28 cases per 100,000. The underlying histology of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which can also occur in connective tissue diseases. The incidences of other interstitial pneumonias such as non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) are less frequent but also occur as an expression of interstitial lung disease in the connective tissue diseases. Moreover, there is significant crossover of these three interstitial pneumonias so that cases of IPF/UIP may also reveal fibrotic NSIP and be complicated by episodes of AIP. This implies common injuries but dissimilar histological responses. All of these processes are characterized by epithelial injury, uncontrolled fibroproliferation and the deposition of collagen, irrespective of the histology. It is clear that a better understanding of the genesis of the interstitial pneumonias is required before effective interventions can be developed.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> A total of 4,486 participants were enrolled, and lung tissue was obtained from 3,333 of these participants.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design:</u></strong> Written informed consent of each participant was required before any LTRC procedure was performed. Phenotypic data were then obtained that included recording of relevant medical information, a limited exposure history, radiological evaluation, and pulmonary physiological and lung function testing. Questionnaires were administered to determine the extent of symptoms, associated medical illnesses, smoking, environmental and occupational exposures, and quality of life. Laboratory testing included pulmonary function testing, a six-minute walk test, and chest x-ray CT. Blood specimens were collected both for defining the clinical phenotype of donors and to obtain serum, plasma, and DNA for later investigative purposes. At the time of surgery, lung tissues were collected and processed for long-term storage. The LTRC collected only the 'non-tumorous' portions of lung tissue from surgical procedures performed for primary or metastatic lung tumors and received those specimens only after the local pathologist had procured all tissue required for clinical care. Samples of appropriate size were cut and placed in formalin, RNAlater, glutaraldehyde, or liquid nitrogen within 30 minutes of excision (approximately 5% of cases exceeded this target time). Blood and tissue specimens were subsequently shipped to a central Tissue Repository for further processing and long-term storage. A Radiology Center provided quality control and quality assessment of CT data. A Data Coordinating Center managed study operations and maintained a repository of study data.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions:</u></strong> LTRC established a biospecimen collection that is unique in its size, diseases included, standardization of methods, and extent of phenotypic data, serving as a valuable resource to facilitate research on the pathobiology of lung diseases.</p>",

The objectives of the study were: (1) to identify factors related to the development of CHD, (2) compare the etiology of disease in rural versus urban men, and (3) determine the prevalence and incidence of CHD and other cardiovascular diseases in Puerto Rican males.</p>\n<p>Background: As Puerto Rico became more industrialized in the 1940s and 1950s, mortality rates for CHD increased. Since many factors related to CHD can be relatively homogenous within a population, two contrasting subgroups were selected for study in Puerto Rico: a rural population of men from a mountainous community and an urban population selected from San Juan. The NHLBI initiated the Puerto Rico Heart Health Program in May, 1965 as a prospective study of lifestyle, environmental and biological factors in the progression of cardiovascular disease in Puerto Rican men.</p>\n<p>Participants: A total of 9,824 (2,976 rural, 6,848 urban) men, age 45 to 64 were examined at the baseline exam.</p>\n<p>Design: The examination consisted of standardized questionnaires to determine education, occupation, smoking habits, and physical activity. Trained interviewers conducted a nutritional survey through a 24 hour diet recall. Subjects were also examined to determine prevalent cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular abnormalities. The examination included vital capacity, a 12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests for hematocrit, glucose, serum cholesterol, serum glycercides and lipoprotein electrophoresis. A medical history was also obtained. Three additional exams, approximately three years apart, were conducted and morbidity and mortality follow-up concluded in 1980.</p>",

In 2011, Medicare reimbursements for oxygen-related costs for people with COPD exceeded two billion dollars. The quality of life of a person with COPD decreases as the disease progresses, making treating and managing COPD in the moderate stages important. The benefits of oxygen supplementation were studied in the 1970s, but these benefits were specific to people with COPD who have severe resting hypoxemia. The LOTT trial was designed to address the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen therapy in treating people with COPD who have moderately low blood oxygen levels at rest or who have normal blood oxygen levels at rest, but have low or very low blood oxygen levels during exercise.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> There were a total of 1759 people screened for eligibility for the LOTT trial. Of the 1759 screened, 738 people with COPD were selected for randomization with 368 randomly assigned to the supplemental-oxygen group and 370 to the no-supplemental-oxygen group.</p>\n<p>Of the 738 people with COPD who underwent randomization, 133 (18%) had resting desaturation only, 319 (43%) had exercise-induced desaturation only, and 286 (39%) had both types of desaturation. Furthermore, in the supplemental-oxygen group, 220 people were prescribed 24-hour oxygen and 148 were prescribed oxygen during exercise and sleep only.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design:</u></strong> The LOTT trial was originally designed to test whether the use of supplemental oxygen would result in a longer time to death for people with COPD and moderate resting desaturation. After seven months, the trial design was judged to be infeasible; therefore, the trial was redesigned to include people with exercise-induced desaturation with a primary composite outcome of death or first hospitalization for any cause, whichever occurs first. Other outcomes measured included: death, health care utilization, COPD exacerbation, quality of life measurements, anxiety, depression, and measures of functional status.</p>\n<p>Potential participants were screened using questionnaires, a breathing test, a brief physical exam, a blood draw, and measurements of resting and walking blood oxygen levels. Based on those results, eligible participants returned for a second screening visit for further evaluations. At the end of the second visit, eligible participants were assigned randomly to supplemental oxygen therapy or no oxygen therapy.</p>\n<p>Participants assigned to supplemental oxygen therapy received stationary and/or portable oxygen systems. Participants were required to return for a one hour visit to determine how much oxygen to use while walking and to learn how to use the equipment. Participants who had low blood oxygen levels during rest were instructed to use supplemental oxygen 24 hours per day. Participants with normal resting blood oxygen levels, but low or very low blood oxygen levels during exercise were instructed to use it during physical activity and sleep. Throughout the treatment period, participants were asked to keep records of the number of oxygen tanks emptied or pounds of oxygen delivered, meter readings, and changes in equipment. Study officials contacted participants weekly for the first month, monthly for the next five months, and then every two months until the Year 1 study visit. Participants assigned to receive no oxygen treatment were contacted one week after assignment for a check-up.</p>\n<p>All participants returned for study visits once a year for up to seven years. At each of these visits, participants completed some of the same tests and questionnaires from the screening visit. Participants underwent a blood draw during the one year study visit. Participants in both treatment groups received two phone calls each year to check on status and use of oxygen. In addition, participants in both groups were asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire by mail at four months and sixteen months. Medicare claims were collected for the duration of each participant's enrollment in the study.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions:</u></strong> In participants with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, the prescription of long-term supplemental oxygen did not result in a longer time to death or first hospitalization than no long-term supplemental oxygen, nor did it provide sustained benefit with regard to any of the other measured outcomes.</p>\n<p>Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial Research Group, Albert RK, Au DH, Blackford AL, Casaburi R, Cooper JA Jr, Criner GJ, Diaz P, Fuhlbrigge AL, Gay SE, Kanner RE, MacIntyre N, Martinez FJ, Panos RJ, Piantadosi S, Sciurba F, Shade D, Stibolt T, Stoller JK, Wise R, Yusen RD, Tonascia J, Sternberg AL, Bailey W.

HHT (also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) is an inherited bleeding disorder. Over 95% of patients develop recurrent epistaxis, which may be severe and result in chronic anemia, need for iron infusions and blood transfusions, substantial psychiatric comorbidity (including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder) and reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HHT is clinically diagnosed using the Curacao criteria, which consists of 1) spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, 2) telangiectasias at characteristic sites, 3) visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or telangiectasias, and 4) a first degree relative with HHT (inheritance is usually autosomal dominant). Patients with three criteria are considered to have definite HHT, and those with 2 criteria probable HHT. HHT affects approximately 1 in 3,800 individuals. Significant manifestations of HHT often do not appear until the third or fourth decades, sometimes later.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong>: 144 patients from 11 clinical centers were enrolled.<br></p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: This is a multi-center, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide in patients with HHT and chronic epistaxis leading to iron-deficiency anemia or requiring intravenous iron infusions or blood transfusion.</p>\n<p>Screening evaluation included the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) with three-month recall, which reflected the patient's history of epistaxis and bleeding over the prior three months, as well as detailed review of iron infusion and red cell transfusion over the preceding six months. Eligible patients were provided a diary to record the duration of each epistaxis event that occurred during the 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit, and then returned for the baseline randomization visit, at which time patients underwent genetic testing, if this had not been previously performed, and completed an ESS with 4-week recall and quality of life assessments. <br></p>\n<p>Patients were randomized 2:1, stratified by study site, to either pomalidomide 4 mg/day or matching placebo during each of six 28 day cycles (24 weeks). Patients were seen every four weeks during treatment, and at a 4-week post-treatment follow-up visit to measure the ESS (with 4-week recall), laboratory assessments including iron stores and need for iron infusion, CBC, and metabolic profile. Patients were assessed for adverse events (AE) throughout the study. Treatment dosage could be reduced, or temporarily or permanently discontinued following AE-specific guidelines related to fatigue, cytopenias or other toxicities.<br>Quality of life assessments were completed at baseline, and the 12- and 24-week visits, and the 4-week post-treatment follow-up visit using validated NIH instruments of 1) Neuro-QOL satisfaction with social roles and activities, 2) PROMIS emotional distress – depression, and 3) PROMIS fatigue, and the HHT-specific quality of life instrument developed specifically for this study. The effect of pomalidomide on duration of epistaxis was assessed via diary between weeks 8-12, 20-24 and the 4-week post-treatment period.<br></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>:** **Among patients with HHT, pomalidomide treatment resulted in a significant, clinically relevant reduction in epistaxis severity.

Whereas almost all patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progress, a variable proportion of patients with other common ILDs, including connective tissue disease associated ILD, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and unclassifiable ILD, develop progressive fibrosing ILD. There are criteria that effectively identify those experiencing ILD progression. However, the criteria do not allow patients who are at risk to be identified before progression occurs.</p>\n<p>Several blood-based biomarkers have been linked to differential progression in patients with IPF and other fibrosing ILDs. Inflammatory signaling also appears to have a prominent role in fibrotic-predominant ILDs. As such, cytokines, interleukins, and other immune mediators might serve as useful biomarkers of progressive fibrosing ILD. The PF-ILD Proteomics study was a targeted investigation of inflammation-related proteins to identify and validate novel biomarkers of progressive fibrosing ILD in patients with fibrotic connective tissue disease-associated ILD, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and unclassifiable ILD.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> There were 589 participants. The discovery cohort comprised 385 participants and the validation cohort comprised 204 participants.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Design:</u></strong> PF-ILD Proteomics was a multicenter cohort analysis study. Peripheral blood was collected from consenting patients and plasma was isolated according to center-specific protocols. Relative plasma concentrations for 368 biomarkers were determined with use of a semi-quantitative, targeted proteomic platform. Patients from UC Davis and UCSF comprised the discovery cohort and those from UTSW comprised the validation cohort.</p>\n<p>Participants who were alive with less than 10% relative decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 12 months-after blood draw were considered to have non-progressive ILD. Participants who died of any cause, underwent lung transplant, or experienced 10% or greater relative FVC decline within 12 months of blood draw were deemed to have progressive fibrosing ILD.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions:</u></strong> 17 plasma biomarkers of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease were identified and showed consistent associations across ILD subtypes.</p>",

Aside from lung transplantation, which approximately only 1% of participants will receive, there is no FDA-approved therapy. Abnormal acid gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) has been well described in participants with IPF and is thought to play a role in the progression of the disease. The several retrospective cohort studies that have assessed the association of anti-acid therapies for GER with clinical outcomes in IPF have had inconsistent results.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong>: A total of 58 participants were enrolled.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: The WRAP-IPF trial was a multicenter, unblinded randomized clinical trial with participants randomized to either laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery or no surgery.

Part of this program was the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, a standardized series of cross-sectional surveys of various North American populations designed to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemias and to describe the distributions of lipids and lipoproteins in major ethnic and social groups. In addition to contributing to the aggregate analysis, each independent population-based study was designed with capabilities for separate analyses of lipid and lipoprotein distributions. The participating populations were not selected to be a probability sample representative of the North American population per se, but by virtue of their size and economic and geographical diversity, they provide a useful cross-sectional group.</p>\n<p>The Family Study was the third phase of the Lipids Research Clinics North American Population Studies. The Family Study was designed to obtain knowledge of the distribution of lipids and lipoproteins among family members and of the association of familial and genetic attributes to dyslipoproteinemias.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong> An association between serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease is well established. A system was developed for classifying hyperlipoproteinemias into six types of patterns, as a basis for characterizing lipoprotein disorders. The Lipid Research Clinics was thus created to improve the detection of and clinical management of hyperlipoproteinemias. The three primary objectives were: 1) to acquire data on the prevalence of different types of hyperlipoproteinemia in various age and ethnic groups, with special emphasis on the nature and frequency of genetic forms; 2) to collect reliable data on the prevalence and incidence of atherosclerosis in different types of hyperlipoproteinemia; and 3) to conduct an intervention trial to determine if lowering plasma lipid levels would reduce the risk of CHD.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Participants:</u></strong> There were 60,495 participants.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Conclusions:</u></strong> Data from this study confirm findings from earlier studies in developed countries, showing age-related differences in plasma lipid levels. However, for overall distributions, the LRC data showed slightly lower cholesterol and markedly higher trigylceride values than those previously reported for North America. Some variation in plasma lipid values was evident among the clinic populations.</p>\n<p>The large number of participants within most subgroups permitted a variety of analytic and comparative studies. For example, data from the large pediatric population revealed a drop in plasma cholesterol levels in adolescent males and females. Males aged 20-50 years had higher cholesterol levels than females in the same age group, and higher trigylceride levels between ages 20-70 years. Numbers were also significient for meaningful comparisons between lipid distributions of females who were taking sex hormones and those who were not; in females taking sex hormones, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher for subjects younger than 45 years, but slightly lower after age 45, than lipid levels in females not taking hormones (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/312704/\">Circulation 1979; 60(2):427-439</a>).</p>",

The database can also be useful to advance future AI-based research on image-based object segmentation and analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>In pediatric patients with respiratory abnormalities, it is important to understand the alterations in regional dynamics of the lungs and other thoracoabdominal components, which in turn requires a quantitative understanding of what is considered as normal in healthy children. Currently, such a normative database of regional respiratory structure and function in healthy children does not exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>\n<p>200 normal children (ages 6-18 years) participated in our research study related to this dataset.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong></p>\n<p>All dMRI scans are acquired from normal children during free-breathing. The dMRI acquisition protocol was as follows: 3T MRI scanner (Verio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), true-FISP bright-blood sequence, TR=3.82 ms, TE=1.91 ms, voxel size ~1×1×6 mm3, 320×320 matrix, bandwidth 258 Hz, and flip angle 76<sup>o</sup>. With recent advances, for each sagittal location across the thorax and abdomen, we acquired 40 2D slices over several tidal breathing cycles at ~480 ms/slice. On average, 35 sagittal locations are imaged, yielding a total of ~1400 2D MRI slices, with a resulting total scan time of 11-13 minutes for any particular study participant.<br>The collected dMRI scan data then went through the procedure of 4D image construction, image processing, object segmentation, and volumetric measurements from segmentations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>4D image construction: For the acquired dMRI scans, we utilized an automated 4D image construction approach to form one 4D image over one breathing cycle (consisting of typically 5-8 respiratory phases) from each acquired dMRI scan to represent the whole dynamic thoraco-abdominal body region. The algorithm selects 175-280 slices (35 sagittal locations × 5-8 respiratory phases) from the 1400 acquired slices in an optimal manner using an optical flux method. 1. Image processing: Intensity standardization is performed on every time point/3D volume of the 4D image so that image values have the same tissue-specific meaning across all subjects. 1. Object segmentation: For each subject, there are 10 objects segmented at both EE and EI time points in this database. They include the thoracoabdominal skin outer boundary, left and right lungs, liver, spleen, left and right kidneys, diaphragm, and left and right hemi-diaphragms. All dMRI scans utilize large field of view images, which include the full thorax and abdomen to the inferior aspect of the kidneys in the sagittal plane. We used a pretrained U-Net based deep learning network to first segment all objects, and then all auto-segmentation results were visually checked and manually refined as needed, under the supervision of a radiologist with over 25 years of expertise in MRI and thoracoabdominal radiology. Manual segmentations have been performed for all objects in all datasets. 1. Volumetric measurements based on object segmentations for lung volumes (left and right separately) at EE and EI, as well as for chest wall and diaphragm excursion volumes (left and right separately) are reported.\n<strong>Conclusions</strong></li>\n</ol>",

In addition, the study sought to determine if participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who were assigned to inhaled corticosteroids had a lower rate of decline in lung function and lower incidence of respiratory morbidity compared to participants assigned to placebo. Also, the study sought to determine the long-term effects of smoking cessation and continued smoking, on cardiopulmonary morbidity, mortality, and the rate of decline in the one second forced expiratory volume in men and women with early chronic obstructive lung disease who have been followed prospectively for 12 to 15 years.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **A total of 5887 participants were enrolled.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions: <strong>Participants in the two smoking intervention groups showed significantly smaller declines in Forced Expiratory Volume 1 (FEV1) than did those in the control group. Most of this difference occurred during the first year following entry into the study and was attributable to smoking cessation, with those who achieved sustained smoking cessation experiencing the largest benefit. The small noncumulative benefit associated with use of the active bronchodilator vanished after the bronchodilator was discontinued at the end of the study. The authors concluded that an aggressive smoking intervention program significantly reduced the age-related decline in FEV1 in middle-aged smokers with mild airways obstruction. Use of an inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator resulted in a relatively small improvement in FEV1 that appeared to be reversed after the drug was discontinued. Use of the bronchodilator did not influence the long-term decline of FEV1. Additionally, the study showed that lung function decline in the participants treated with the inhaled corticosteroid was statistically no different from that in the placebo group. Corticosteroid use did, however, result in 25 percent fewer respiratory symptoms and nearly 50 percent fewer outpatient visits for respiratory problems. However, after three years, bone density in the hip and back was lower in the corticosteroid group.</strong><br></strong></p>",

Surprisingly, there are few treatments available to address the pathobiology of COPD other than cessation of smoking. The development and progression of COPD are associated with increased inflammatory response(s) and increased oxidative stress in the lung. Thus, one approach to the development of novel therapies is the stimulation of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4780\">NFE2L2</a>/Nrf2) is a transcription factor activated by oxidative stress. Nrf2 activity promotes anti-oxidant enzymes, and anti-oxidant enzymes play key roles in cellular defenses. Sulforaphane, a derivative of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to stimulate Nrf2 activity in both <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> experiments. For example, activation of Nrf2 protected mice from developing emphysema after chronic smoke exposure and decreased oxidative stress. Similarly, activation of Nrf2 in human COPD lung cells resulted in decreased oxidative stress. Therefore, this study was designed to assess whether daily ingestion of sulforaphane by COPD participants for four weeks increased Nrf2 activity in alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells.</p>\n<p>**Participants: **There were a total of 89 participants randomized to one of three treatment arms. Of these, 31 participants were randomized to the placebo arm, and 29 participants were randomized to the each of the sulforaphane arms. One participant withdrew from the placebo arm, therefore, a total of 88 participants completed the study.</p>\n<p>**Design: **Participants were assigned to receive sulforaphane at 25 micromoles (4.4mg), sulforaphane at 150 micromoles (26.6 mg), or placebo (microcellulose) once daily by mouth. Computer-generated treatment assignments were blinded to participants, clinical staff, and study staff. Doses were back-filled with methylcellulose and presented in similar capsules to compensate for appearance and weight differences in sulforaphane and placebo treatments arms.</p>\n<p>There were a total of five study visits over the six-week study period. Prior to randomization, participants were assessed for eligibility, which included baseline data collection. Participants provided medical histories, underwent a physical examination, pre-and-post bronchodilator spirometry, lung volume measurements, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), and pulse oximetry over the six-week study period. Follow up data and biospecimens were collected at the final visit, which was targeted for four weeks after randomization. Two fiberoptic bronchoscopies were performed under sedation to collect endobronchial brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage used to isolate alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells. The first bronchoscopy was performed on the day of randomization, and the second bronchoscopy was performed the day after the final visit. In addition, nasal brushings were obtained prior to bronchoscopy to isolate nasal epithelial cells.</p>\n<p>The primary outcomes were changes in Nrf2 target gene expression at four weeks in alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells. The target genes for the primary outcome were NQ01, H01, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1645\">AKR1C1</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8644\">AKR1C3</a>.

The improvement in survival that accompanied the use of mechanical ventilation also brought about an increase in the incidence of pulmonary complications. The principal complication occurs in the form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Barotrauma and oxygen toxicity are considered to be in the pathogenesis for this disorder. Considerable interest in high frequency ventilation for preterm infants was generated when animal studies indicated high frequency ventilation to be effective in promoting gas exchange without apparent adverse effects. High Frequency Ventilation (HFV) delivers small tidal volumes at high frequencies of 4 to 15 Hz, and animal studies had indicated that HFV was associated with effective gas exchange, less barotrauma, and lower mean airway pressure. However, the efficacy and safety of HFV in preterm infants had not been studied. The HIFI Planning Phase was initiated in August 1984, and recruitment and intervention began in February, 1986.

Many studies have explored the use of various types of stem or progenitor cells in participants with chronic ischemic HF, with encouraging results. Several clinical trials have suggested that MSCs and CPCs are both safe and beneficial in participants with ischemic HF. At the time of this study, no information was available on the efficacy of MSCs and CPCs in humans, however, both cell types have been shown to attenuate left ventricle (LV) dysfunction in animal models. Preclinical models indicate that combining MSCs and CPCs increases the therapeutic effects, but this had not yet been tested in humans.</p>\n<p>The CONCERT-HF study was initiated to assess whether autologous MSCs and CPCs, alone or in combination, can be manufactured and delivered to participants with ischemic HF; are well-tolerated; and improve LV function, quality of life, and functional capacity, and/or reduce scar size.</p>\n<p>**Participants **</p>\n<p>A total of 125 participants were randomized with 33 participants randomized to the MSCs and CPCs group, 29 participants to the MSCs alone group, 31 participants to the CPCs alone group, and 32 participants to the placebo group.</p>\n<p>**Design **</p>\n<p>The CONCERT-HF study was a multi-center Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of MSCs alone, CPCs alone, and their combination compared with placebo as well as each other in patients with ischemic HF. In Stage 1 (open label, lead-in study) participants were randomized 1:1 to either a standard-of-care control group (i.e., they did not undergo harvest, mapping, or injection procedures) or combination therapy (MSCs + CPCs, as described for Stage 2) to complete safety assessments. Once approval was granted for Stage 2, participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to one of four treatments: placebo, autologous MSCs (target dose, 150 × 106 cells), autologous CPCs (target dose, 5 × 106 cells), or a combination of autologous MSCs and CPCs. At the harvest visit, right ventricular endocardial biopsy (EMB) was performed in participants randomized to receive CPCs alone or a combination of MSCs and CPCs. Participants randomized to receive MSCs alone or placebo had a sham procedure (right heart catheterization without EMB). All participants underwent a bone marrow aspiration and approximately 14 weeks later had transendocardial, electromechanically-guided injections of study product.</p>\n<p>Visits occurred at 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after study product injection. A telephone contact took place at 24 months to assess the participant's current medications, as well as morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p>Study endpoints included measures of safety, feasibility, and efficacy. Safety outcomes included all adverse events grade 2 and higher, including major adverse cardiac events (MACE) related to HF (death, hospitalization for worsening HF, and HF exacerbation not requiring hospitalization). Efficacy endpoints included quality of life, MRI measures of LV function and structure, functional capacity, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels.</p>\n<p>**Conclusions **</p>\n<p>In patients with ischemic HF, autologous MSCs and CPCs, alone or in combination, are safe and feasible; CPCs were associated with a reduction in the incidence of MACE related to HF compared to placebo; MSCs, either alone or in combination with CPCs, were associated with improved quality of life; these seemingly beneficial effects of CPCs and MSCs on clinical outcome were not associated with changes in LV function or structure; and combination therapy with MSCs and CPCs was associated with the best clinical outcomes with respect to both MACE related to HF and quality of life.</p>",

It is the most common type of chronic lung disease in children and young adults and may result in early death. There is no cure for this disease. The primary cause of death in individuals with CF is progressive obstructive pulmonary disease associated with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection. PA infection can occur early in life and can become highly resistant to antibiotics. Once an individual has been diagnosed with chronic PA infection, it is almost impossible to manage effectively. The need exists for an effective treatment to control and eliminate PA infection. Past research has shown that if PA infection is treated early, there is a greater likelihood that it may be eliminated completely.</p>\n<p>Participants: There were 304 participants.</p>\n<p>Design: Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 antibiotic regimens for 18 months (six 12-week quarters) between December 2004 and June 2009. Participants randomized to cycled therapy received tobramycin inhalation solution (300 mg twice a day) for 28 days, with oral ciprofloxacin (15-20 mg/kg twice a day) or oral placebo for 14 days every quarter, while participants randomized to culture-based therapy received the same treatments only during quarters with positive P aeruginosa cultures. The primary end points were time to pulmonary exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics and proportion of PA - positive cultures.</p>\n<p>Conclusions: No difference in the rate of exacerbation or prevalence of PA positivity was detected between cycled and culture-based therapies. Adding ciprofloxacin produced no benefits (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21893650/\">Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 2011; 165(9):847-856</a>).<br></p>",

The median survival of patients with IPF after the onset of symptoms is 2 to 5 years. Prior animal and human studies in pulmonary fibrosis provide a compelling rationale to examine anticoagulation as a therapeutic approach in IPF. Large epidemiologic studies link IPF with thrombosis-related clinical events, such as an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome and deep vein thrombosis. The suspected causal relationship may extend beyond simple coagulation cascade-induced thrombus formation, as procoagulant enzymes may directly stimulate fibrosis <em>via</em> cell surface receptor - mediated responses.</p>\n<p>Participants: Patients aged 35 to 80 years with progressive IPF were potentially eligible. Progressive IPF was defined as a history of (1) worsening of dyspnea, or (2) physiologic deterioration defined as an absolute decline of either FVC greater than or equal to 10% or DlCO greater than or equal to 15%, a reduction in arterial oxygen saturation of greater than or equal to 5%, or progression of radiographic findings. Between December 14, 2009 and April 1, 2011, 145 subjects were enrolled: 72 in the warfarin group and 73 in the placebo group. The mean age for the population was 67 years. 27% of the subjects were women and 92% were white.</p>\n<p>Participants were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: current indication for, or treatment with, warfarin, prasugrel, or clopidogrel combined with aspirin; the presence of an increased risk of bleeding; a recent cerebral vascular accident or gastrointestinal bleeding; any current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled comorbid illness; and their presence on the active list for lung transplantation.</p>\n<p>Design: ACE-IPF was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of warfarin targeting an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 in patients with IPF. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to warfarin or matching placebo for a planned treatment period of 48 weeks. Study subjects were provided two strengths of warfarin tablets (1 mg and 2.5 mg) or matching placebos. Subjects measured their INR with encrypted meters at least weekly. Participants were seen at screening, baseline, and at 16, 32, and 48 weeks after enrollment. Home monitoring was validated by plasma INR measurement at the week 1 and 16 visits.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was a composite endpoint based on the time to all-cause mortality; nonelective, nonbleeding hospitalization; or a decrease in the absolute FVC greater than or equal to 10% from baseline value. Secondary outcome measures included rates of mortality, hospitalization, respiratory-related hospitalization, acute exacerbation, bleeding, cardiovascular events, and changes over time in FVC, 6-minute walk test distance, DlCO, plasma fibrin D-dimer levels, and quality of life (QOL).</p>\n<p>Conclusions: The study did not show a benefit for warfarin in the treatment of patients with progressive IPF and was terminated due to excess mortality in the warfarin treatment group. Treatment with warfarin was associated with an increased risk of mortality in an IPF population who lacked other indications for anticoagulation.</p>\n<p>Reported causes of death indicated 11 of the 14 were respiratory-related in the warfarin group versus three of the three in the placebo group. There were also three cardiovascular deaths in the warfarin group versus none in the placebo group. No deaths were attributed to bleeding.

After interim analysis presented safety concerns regarding the three drug regimen, the protocol was modified to evaluate only N-acetylcysteine effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Background: IPF is a chronic, progressive lung disease of unknown cause that is characterized by the histopathological or radiologic patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia in a typical clinical setting. The median survival of participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after diagnosis is 2 to 5 years. To date, no pharmacologic therapies have been shown to improve survival. Acetylcysteine has been suggested as a beneficial treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, although data from placebo-controlled studies are lacking.</p>\n<p>Design: Patients with mild-to-moderate impairment in pulmonary function were randomly assigned to receive a three-drug regimen (prednisone, azathioprine, and acetylcysteine), acetylcysteine alone (plus matched placebos for prednisone and azathioprine), or matched placebos for each of the active therapies. After the planned midpoint interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended discontinuation of the three-drug regimen because of an excess in the number of deaths, hospitalizations, and serious adverse events among patients in the combination-therapy group, as compared with the placebo group. After NHLBI accepted this recommendation on October 14, 2011, the three-drug regimen was discontinued and patients were recruited for only the acetylcysteine group and the placebo group. Patients were seen at the clinical centers for screening, at baseline, and at 4, 15, 30, 45, and 60 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in FVC over 60 weeks.</p>\n<p>Conclusions: As compared with placebo, acetylcysteine offered no significant benefit with respect to the preservation of FVC in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with mild-to-moderate impairment in lung function.

Effects on mortality, the magnitude and durability of benefits, and criteria for the selection of participants have not been established.</p>\n<p>Participants: A total of 1,218 participants with severe emphysema underwent pulmonary rehabilitation and were randomly assigned at 17 centers to undergo lung-volume-reduction surgery (bilateral stapled wedge resection) or to receive continued medical treatment. Participants were randomized after a 6-10 week pulmonary rehabilitation period and participants with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) that was 20 percent or less of predicted and a homogeneous distribution of emphysema or carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 20 percent or less of predicted were not eligible for randomization due to poor post-surgery prognosis for death or functional improvement.</p>\n<p>Conclusions: Overall, lung-volume-reduction surgery increases the chance of improved exercise capacity but does not confer a survival advantage over medical therapy. It does yield a survival advantage for participants with both predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low base-line exercise capacity. Participants previously reported to be at high risk and those with non-upper-lobe emphysema and high base-line exercise capacity are poor candidates for lung-volume-reduction surgery, because of increased mortality and negligible functional gain.

Biospecimens from PETAL CLOVERS include plasma, and whole blood. Please note that use of biospecimens in genetic research is subject to a tiered consent.</p>\n<p><strong>Available Data</strong>: The data available for request now include Long Term Outcome data.</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives</strong>: To compare the effects of a restrictive fluid strategy (with early use of vasopressors) to a liberal fluid strategy in participants with sepsis-induced hypotension.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>: Intravenous fluid resuscitation is a common therapy used in the initial treatment of participants with septic shock and sepsis-induced hypotension. The goal of initial fluid therapy is to increase depleted or functionally reduced intravascular volume that occurs in sepsis due to a vasodilated vascular network. However, intravenous fluid resuscitation can create dilutional coagulopathy, fluid overload, and pathogenic edema in the lungs and other organs. Vasopressor agents are also commonly used to treat hypoperfusion by inducing constriction of arterioles and venules and increasing cardiac contractility. Vasopressor therapy also comes with risks that include vasoconstriction resulting in tissue ischemia, increased cardiac workload, and arrhythmias. Clinicians have used these strategies, typically in combination, to provide supportive care for participants with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. However, at the time of the CLOVERS study, there was limited data to guide specific use of these therapies, including fluid volumes, in the early care of participants with sepsis-induced hypotension. The CLOVERS study hypothesized that a restrictive fluid strategy used during the first 24-hours of resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypotension would lead to lower mortality before discharge home by day 90 than a liberal fluid strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong>: A total of 1,563 participants, from 60 medical centers, of the planned 2,230 participants were enrolled, with 782 assigned to the restrictive fluid group and 781 to the liberal fluid group. Enrollment in the trial was ended after the second interim analysis due to a lack of significant difference observed between the two 24-hour strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: This study was a multi-center, prospective, phase 3 randomized non-blinded interventional trial of fluid treatment strategies in the first 24 hours for participants with sepsis-induced hypotension. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a restrictive fluid strategy (with early vasopressor use) or a liberal fluid strategy. In each group, the assigned protocol was followed for a period of 24 hours. The restrictive fluid protocol prioritized vasopressors as the primary treatment for sepsis-induced hypotension, with 'rescue fluids' being permitted for prespecified indications that suggested severe intravascular volume depletion. The liberal fluid protocol consisted of a recommended initial 2000-ml intravenous infusion of isotonic crystalloid, followed by fluid boluses administered on the basis of clinical triggers (e.g., tachycardia) with 'rescue vasopressors' permitted for prespecified indications. A protocol amendment implemented in October, 2019, allowed for limiting the initial infusion to 1,000 ml if the participant's blood pressure and heart rate had stabilized and the clinical assessment was that the participant was unlikely to benefit from additional intravenous fluid administration. The clinical team could override the protocol-specified care instructions at any time if it was judged to be in the best interest of the participant.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was death from any cause before discharge home by day 90. Secondary outcomes included 28-day measures of the number of days free from ventilator use, days free from renal-replacement therapy, days free from vasopressor use, days out of the ICU, and days out of the hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Among participants with sepsis-induced hypotension, the restrictive fluid strategy that was used in this trial did not result in significantly lower (or higher) mortality, or other measures of recovery such as length of hospital stay, before discharge home by day 90 than the liberal fluid strategy.</p>",

Progression to end-stage respiratory insufficiency and death within 5 years after the onset of symptoms is characteristic. To date, no pharmacologic therapies have definitively been shown to improve survival or quality of life in participants with this disease.</p>\n<p>Participants with severe IPF have abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature leading to decreased levels of resting and exercise-induced production of nitric oxide. Since nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, reduced levels are associated with pulmonary vasoconstriction and impaired gas exchange.</p>\n<p>Sildenafil (Revatio, Pfizer) is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that stabilizes the second messenger of nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which leads to pulmonary vasodilatation. Such vasodilatation could improve ventilation–perfusion matching and thus gas exchange in with IPF.</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: STEP-IPF was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral sildenafil (20 mg three times daily). Participants meeting eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sildenafil or matched placebo with the use of a permuted-block design, with stratification according to clinical center. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of an improvement of at least 20% in the 6-minute walk distance at 12 weeks, as compared with baseline.

This phase lasts about 30 days and is designed to eliminate cancer cells. Success of treatment is measured by the percentage of myeloblasts, i.e. immature white blood cells, detected in the patient following primary induction. Patients with greater than 15% myeloblasts did not sufficiently respond to standard therapy and are \"induction failures.\" Currently, these patients have very poor prognoses and few clinical options. There are 30 patient cases that make up the TARGET AML Induction failure dataset, each with a primary tumor sample, a \"normal\" fibroblast sample grown from the patient's bone marrow, and a sample obtained at the end of induction. The trios for each case are characterized with next generation sequencing platforms to include whole genome, miRNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq. Gene expression and copy number analyses were also determined from mRNA-seq and whole genome sequencing respectively.</p>\n<p>Please visit the TARGET website, <a href=\"http://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target\">https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/target</a>, for additional information on this and other TARGET genomics projects. <strong>Please see the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/target/using-target-data/citing\">TARGET Publication Guidelines</a> for updated details on the sharing of any TARGET substudy data.</strong></p>",

    "description": "<p>Recently, significant progress has been made in characterizing and sequencing the genomic alterations in statistically robust numbers of samples from several types of cancer. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and other similar efforts are identifying genomic alterations associated with specific cancers (e.g., copy number aberrations, rearrangements, point mutations, epigenomic changes, etc.). The availability of these multi-dimensional data to the scientific community sets the stage for the development of new molecularly targeted cancer interventions. Understanding the comprehensive functional changes in cancer proteomes arising from genomic alterations and other factors is the next logical step in the development of high-value candidate protein biomarkers. Hence, proteomics can greatly advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease pathology via the analysis of changes in protein expression, their modifications and variations, as well as protein-protein interaction, signaling pathways and networks responsible for cellular functions such as apoptosis and oncogenesis.</p>\n<p>Realizing this great potential, the NCI launched the second phase of the CPTC initiative in September 2011. Renamed the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, CPTAC is beginning to leverage its analytical outputs from Phase I to define cancer proteomes on genomically-characterized biospecimens. The purpose of this integrative approach is to provide the broad scientific community with knowledge that links genotype to proteotype and ultimately phenotype.</p>\n<p>The data contained in this dataset are derived from samples designed to confirm CPTAC findings from the TCGA samples. These confirmatory samples contain breast, ovarian, colon, and lung tumors collected via a protocol optimized for proteomics. Specifically, ischemic time of the sample was controlled and restricted to less than 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>ACGT, Inc. produced whole exome, mRNAseq, and miRNAseq for these samples. Corresponding proteomic data are available at: <a href=\"https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/\">https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptacPublic/</a></p>\n<p>The study design was to profile colon, breast, ovarian, and lung tumors both genomically and proteomically. Germline DNA was obtained from blood. Normal control samples for proteomics varied by organ site: adjacent colon tissue for colon cases, contralateral breast tissue for some breast cases, and Fallopian tube fimbria for some ovarian cases. Lung cases had no normal control for proteomic analysis. All cancer samples were derived from primary and untreated tumors.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Recently, significant progress has been made in characterizing and sequencing the genomic alterations in statistically robust numbers of samples from several types of cancer. For example, <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas\">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.icgc-argo.org/docs/data-access/icgc-25k-data\">International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)</a> and other similar efforts are identifying genomic alterations associated with specific cancers (e.g., copy number aberrations, rearrangements, point mutations, epigenomic changes, etc.) The availability of these multi-dimensional data to the scientific community sets the stage for the development of new molecularly targeted cancer interventions. Understanding the comprehensive functional changes in cancer proteomes arising from genomic alterations and other factors is the next logical step in the development of high-value candidate protein biomarkers. Hence, proteomics can greatly advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease pathology via the analysis of changes in protein expression, their modifications and variations, as well as protein=protein interaction, signaling pathways and networks responsible for cellular functions such as apoptosis and oncogenesis. Realizing this great potential, the NCI launched the third phase of the CPTC initiative in September 2016. As the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, CPTAC continues to define cancer proteomes on genomically-characterized biospecimens. The purpose of this integrative approach was to provide the broad scientific community with knowledge that links genotype to proteotype and ultimately phenotype. In this third phase of CPTAC, the program aims to expand on CPTAC II and genomically and proteomically characterize over 2000 samples from 10 cancer types (Lung Adenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Clear cell renal Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous Melanoma, Sarcoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma) .Germline DNA is obtained from blood and Normal control samples for proteomics varied by organ site.

Crenolanib, a potent type I pan-FLT3 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=FLT3\">GeneID:2322</a>) inhibitor, is effective against both internal tandem duplications (ITD) and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. While crenolanib monotherapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory AML patients, responses are transient and relapse eventually occurs. To investigate the mechanisms of crenolanib resistance, we performed whole exome sequencing of AML patient samples before and after crenolanib treatment (122 samples from 59 patients). Unlike other FLT3 inhibitors, crenolanib did not induce FLT3 activation loop mutations, and mutations of the FLT3 \"gatekeeper\" residue were infrequent. Instead, mutations of NRAS (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NRAS\">GeneID:4893</a>) and IDH2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IDH2\">GeneID:3418</a>) arose, mostly as FLT3-independent subclones, while TET2 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=TET2\">GeneID:54790</a>) and IDH1 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IDH1\">GeneID:3417</a>) predominantly co-occurred with the FLT3-mutant clone and were enriched in crenolanib poor-responders. The remaining patients exhibited post-crenolanib expansion of mutations associated with epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and cohesion factors, suggesting diverse non-FLT3 genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of crenolanib resistance. Drug combinations in experimental models restored crenolanib sensitivity.</p>",

We assessed these specimens using whole exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and ex vivo drug sensitivity analyses. Our data reveal novel mutational events not previously detected in AML. We show association of drug response with mutational status, including instances of drug sensitivity that are specific to combinatorial mutational events. Integration with RNA-sequencing also revealed gene expression signatures, which predict a role of specific gene networks in drug response.

Our goal is to create a publicly available dataset of genomic, molecular, clinical, and patient-reported data to enable research. Patients in the US or Canada may register online. Registered patients are sent an online consent form that asks for permission to obtain and analyze their medical records, tumor tissue, saliva, and blood samples. Once enrolled, patients are sent a saliva kit and asked to mail back a saliva sample, which is used to extract germline DNA. Study staff contact participants' medical providers and obtain medical records and a portion of their stored tumor biopsies. Patients may be asked to mail in a blood sample, which is used to extract cell free DNA (cfDNA). Whole exome sequencing (WES) is performed on tumor DNA, germline DNA, and cfDNA; transcriptome sequencing is performed on tumor RNA. Clinically annotated genomic data are used to study specific patient cohorts (including outliers) and to identify mechanisms of response and resistance to therapies. All de-identified data, including genomic, clinical, and patient-reported data, are shared via public databases on a pre-publication and recurring basis as it is generated.

The <a href=\"http://mpcproject.org/\">MPCproject</a> enables any man with metastatic or advanced prostate cancer in the US and Canada to participate in cutting-edge genomic and molecular research, regardless of where they live. Metastatic or advanced prostate cancer patients visit the project website and complete an online questionnaire of basic information about themselves and their cancer. Enrolled patients are mailed saliva and blood draw kits, which can be used to extract germline DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA), respectively. The study team contacts participants' healthcare institutions to obtain medical records and a portion of archived tumor samples. Whole exome sequencing is performed on tumor DNA, germline DNA, and cfDNA, and transcriptome sequencing is performed on tumor RNA. De-identified data, including linked genomic, clinical, and patient-reported data, are shared via public databases on a recurring pre-publication basis. Participants are regularly provided with updates on the study.</p>",

For this study, genomic characterization (WGS 30X, WXS, Total RNAseq) was performed on NCI Standard Risk B-lineage ALL patients who relapse and subsets of NCI High Risk B-lineage ALL patients who relapse as well as two non-relapse control cases for each relapse case. It was hypothesized that the comprehensive characterization of these sample sets will allow the identification of somatic genetic features that will facilitate early intervention to improve cure rates for those enrolled on future trials. Data were generated and genetic subtype was integrated with clinical variables, including age, presenting white blood cell count, sex, race, and levels of minimal residual disease at the end of induction. Additional secondary alterations were identified and included if they occurred in more than 10 patients. The study has been completed and a manuscript has been prepared.</p>",

Further, individuals born with an OFC have higher infant mortality, higher mortality rates at all other stages of life, increased incidence of mental health problems, and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers). Prior genome-wide linkage and association studies have now identified at least 18 genomic regions likely to contribute to the risk for nonsyndromic OFCs. Despite this substantial progress, the functional/pathogenic variants at OFC-associated regions are mostly still unknown. Because previous OFC genomic studies (genome-wide linkage, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and targeted sequencing) are based on relatively sparse genotyping data, they cannot distinguish between causal variants and variants in linkage disequilibrium with unobserved causal variants. Moreover, it is unknown whether the association or linkage signals are due to single common variants, haplotypes of multiple common variants, clusters of multiple rare variants, or some combination. Finally, we cannot yet attribute specific genetic risk to individual cases and case families. <strong>Therefore, the goal of the current study is to identify specific OFC risk variants in Whites by performing whole genome sequencing of parent-case trios.</strong></p>",

Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) are congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. DSD are chronic medical conditions collectively affecting ~1% of the population, frequently requiring life-long care by multiple specialists, and carrying a significant public health burden. Some are associated with life-threatening events, such as adrenal crises in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). DSD are also associated with increased infertility, cancer, gender dysphoria risks, psychosocial distress and pervasive challenges to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients and families. DSD are broadly classified into three categories: sex chromosome DSD, 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD, and further classified according to the type of gonad found in the patient (ovary, testis, ovotestis).</p>\n<p>We were able to increase significantly the diagnostic success for DSD using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), with the identification of disease-causing and likely pathogenic variants in a third of a cohort of 46,XY patients. We have therefore proposed a shift in the diagnostic approach to DSD to use next-gen sequencing as a first-line clinical test, which could lead to faster and more accurate diagnosis, and orient further clinical management, limiting unnecessary, costly, and often invasive endocrine testing and imaging. However many remain unexplained (over half of the XY cases, a significant minority of XX cases, including most ovotesticular DSD, and most syndromic cases).

Mounting evidence suggests that a genetic predisposition exists for this pediatric cancer, although the specific genetic contribution has yet to be identified. EWS has never been linked to a specific cancer predisposition syndrome, although several case reports have been published that describe siblings and cousins with EWS. Furthermore, neuroectodermal tumors appear to occur more commonly in families with EWS. The two consistent epidemiology findings in EWS include a very strong Caucasian predilection and increased rates of hernia in EWS patients and their family members. Finally, the role of genetic microsatellite repeats in EWS tumorigenesis has been recently described, and these GGAA microsatellites are polymorphic in repeat size and location across the genome.<br></p>\n<p>The study goals of this Kids First project include (1) To identify cancer predisposition genes in EWS trios increasing disease risk, (2) To identify genome-wide GGAA microsatellite repeats in EWS trios increasing disease risk, and (3) To identity de novo mutation and structural variant rates in EWS trios reflecting underlying DNA repair defects that increase disease risk. As part of the Kids First Common Fund initiative, this study proposal will further elucidate the genetic contribution to pediatric cancer development. Around 375 of these trios were selected for whole genome sequencing as part of the Gabriella Miller Kids First fund. The EWS trios have been collected as part of the Children's Oncology Group's AEPI10N5 Study (\"Genetic Epidemiology of Ewing Sarcoma\"), and each trio has associated phenotypic data including a detailed family history. We will interrogate the sequence data using our genomic analysis pipeline at the University of Utah and the Utah Science Technology and Research initiative's (USTAR) Center for Genetic Discovery.

The <em>long-term goal</em> of our research program is to ultimately improve neuroblastoma cure rates by first comprehensively defining the genetic basis of the disease. The <em>central hypothesis</em> to be tested here is that neuroblastoma arises largely due to the epistatic interaction of common and rare heritable DNA variation. Here we will perform a comprehensive whole genome sequencing of 563 quartets of neuroblastoma patient germline and diagnostic tumor DNAs and germline DNAs from both parents. The case series was recently collected through a Children's Oncology Group epidemiology clinical trial and is robustly annotated with complete demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity), clinical (e.g. age at diagnosis, stage, risk group), epidemiologic (parental dietary and exposure questionnaire) and biological (e.g. tumor <em>MYCN</em> status and multiple other tumor genomic measures) co-variates. Subjects were consented for genetic research and DNA is immediately available for shipment for sequencing. We propose Illumina-based whole genome sequencing in the 593 \"trio\" germline samples (<strong>Aim 1</strong>; due to missing parent: 487 full neuroblastoma triads, 106 child-single parent dyads = 1673 whole genome sequences) and matched diagnostic tumor DNA (<strong>Aim 2</strong>; N=366) at 30x sequencing depth (N=2039 whole genome sequences). Also in Aim 2 we will perform whole exome (100x) and RNA sequencing on the 366 tumor DNA and 228 tumor RNA samples from this cohort. Finally, we propose a pilot study of structural variation using long-range sequencing in 10 non-overlapping tumor samples chosen based on potentially relevant chromosomal alterations discovered with conventional NGS. Thus, a total of 2277 individual samples and 2655 sequences will be generated. We will use our established analytic pipeline that is currently being used to study the germline genomes of all cases sequenced through the NCI supported Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments program. We plan a three-stage analytic approach, first focusing on classic <em>de novo</em> and inherited Mendelian damaging alterations. We will next integrate our extensive epigenomic data from human neuroblastoma cell lines and genome-wide association study data (N=5,703 neuroblastoma cases to date) to guide a comprehensive assessment of noncoding variants that influence tumor initiation with a recently established analytic pipeline. Finally, we will utilize the tumor DNA analyses to inform relevance via somatic gain or loss of function effects at the sequence and/or copy number levels. All data generated in this project will be immediately placed into the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) and we will compute within this environment by importing our analytic pipelines into the GDC. These data will be fully integrated into the Kids First Data Resource and freely shared with all academically qualified petitioners. This comprehensive data set derived from a large and richly phenotyped series of neuroblastoma DNA quartets will be integrated with existing germline and/or tumor genomic data from over 6,000 neuroblastoma subjects (but none with matched patient-parent germline sequencing data) to provide an unparalleled opportunity to comprehensively discover the genetic basis of neuroblastoma.<br></p>",

The severity of microtia is variable and ranges from subtle deformities in the pinna to absence of the external ear.

Microtia can be an isolated, unilateral or bilateral malformation, or occur solely with ear canal deformities, or with additional craniofacial or syndromic manifestations.

Thus, the primary goal in the treatment of T-ALL is to prevent relapse, which requires accurate risk stratification. Unfortunately, no genetic alterations have been identified to date that are reproducibly prognostic independent of minimal residual disease (MRD), making it difficult at diagnosis to identify which patients are more likely to relapse. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813610/\">AALL0434</a> was a Children's Oncology Group-initiated phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing Capizzi-style escalating methotrexate plus pegaspargase (CMTX) vs. high dose methotrexate (HDMTX), with/without six 5-day courses of nelarabine. Survival on this study was superior to any prior trial for <em>de novo</em> T-ALL, changing the standard of care. Yet, a substantial minority (~15%) of patients had relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. Through the TARGET initiative, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), DNA copy number analysis, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) were performed on 264 T-ALL patients treated on AALL0434, demonstrating recurrent alterations could be grouped into 10 different potentially targetable functional pathways. This analysis was not powered to examine associations between genetic lesions with outcome, because too few patients with r/r disease were included. This project is dedicated to testing the hypothesis that comprehensive genomic profiling of the entire AALL0434 cohort will identify recurrent genetic alterations that can be segregated into biologically relevant deregulated pathways that can be combined with MRD to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes before they relapse and provide rationale for treatment with alternative therapies. In addition, a number of small recent studies demonstrated that many of the biologically relevant alterations in T-ALL occur in non-coding regions of the genome, but no large studies have performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in T-ALL. This project also tests the hypothesis that WGS of a large cohort of patients with T-ALL will identify novel lesions in coding and non-coding regions that will be highly impactful in the understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis. These hypotheses are tested by performing comprehensive genomic profiling (WGS, WES, RNA-Seq, and copy number analysis) of the entire AALL0434 cohort with available samples with the following specific aims: (1) identify recurrent genetic alterations that predict poor outcome in T-ALL; (2) identify novel alterations, including non-coding alterations in T-ALL; and (3) identify germline genetic variants that predispose to T-ALL and to increased toxicity to chemotherapy.</p>",

GCTs are heterogeneous and grouped together due to the presumed common cell of origin, the primordial germ cell (PGC). GCTs typically occur in the testes or ovaries; however, extragonadal GCTs can occur and are likely a result of abnormal germ cell migration during development. Evidence suggests that GCTs, including those diagnosed in adults, are initiated in utero. Thus, alterations in normal embryonic development are likely to be especially relevant to GCT etiology. Germline susceptibility has not been evaluated in an agnostic fashion in pediatric GCT, mainly due to a lack of an adequate number of samples; however, emerging evidence supports a genetic etiology.</p>\n<p>In the two Kids First GCT projects, we will evaluate genetic susceptibility to intracranial and extracranial GCT by sequencing probands and their unaffected parents. The goals of the project are to: 1) evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants in GCT through the use of aggregate burden tests, focusing on genes and established regulatory regions; 2) identify <em>de novo</em> SNVs and CNVs in pediatric GCT using a case-parent triad design; and 3) identify molecular signatures in GCT tumor specimens, overall and by age group and tumor characteristics.

    "description": "<p>Laterality defects occur in approximately 1:10,000 newborns and are associated with a range of structural birth defects and abnormalities of organ positioning. Gut malrotation, biliary atresia, asplenia or polysplenia, complex cardiovascular malformations, and midline defects such as neural tube defects, vertebral anomalies and rib fusions are found in various combinations in patients with laterality defects. In addition, a subset of laterality defects caused by abnormalities of cilia position or function are associated with additional medical problems such as chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis that require specific preventive care; however these patients frequently are undiagnosed until late in disease course. The goal of this project is to elucidate the genetic architecture of laterality disorders in order to inform medical management and risk stratification and to prevent complications. Laterality disorders are genetically heterogeneous and we and others have previously identified single nucleotide variants inherited in an X-linked or autosomal recessive manner as explanations for a minority of cases. In addition, we have demonstrated copy number variants (CNVs) as a mechanism of disease that requires additional investigation. We hypothesize that the majority of cases result from complex genetic inheritance. We propose to investigate this hypothesis using a multifaceted analysis approach in our extremely well phenotyped cohort of 538 probands with laterality disorders. Nested within this cohort are 105 trios who have not had previous sequencing, probands who have had exome sequencing and are excellent candidates for gene discovery <em>via</em> whole genome sequencing (WGS), and families with multiple affected family members for family-based analysis. All trios will be analyzed by transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) including rare variant TDT. <em>De novo</em> mutations will also be identified from trios for potential gene discovery. Using all probands, we will identify the prevalence of pathogenic CNVs. In addition, we will perform burden analyses to identify genes, gene interactions, and pathways important for susceptibility to laterality disorders. Finally, our rare families with multiple affected members will be studied using family based segregation analysis. This comprehensive genetic analysis in patients with laterality disorders is necessary to identify the appropriate clinical diagnostic testing for risk stratification, to elucidate underlying genetic architecture and facilitate novel gene discovery, and to provide essential knowledge about genes and pathways impacting the development of laterality disorders.<br></p>",

    "description": "<p>Almost 5% of all live births in the US (1:20 births) display an inborn defect, including both structural and functional/metabolic abnormalities. These are among the most common causes of Infant mortality in the developed world and underlie nearly half of hospitalizations in the first 3 years of life. Of the 35 major defects observable at birth from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance Program (<a href=\"www.icbdsr.org\">www.icbdsr.org</a>, external link), about half involve the nervous system. Many of these result in lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders. Structural Brain Defects (SBDs) result from errors in development of the central nervous system, including defects in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Many SBDs arise as the consequence of a single gene bi-allelic mutation, and for this reason, occur more commonly in populations or communities with elevated consanguinity.</p>\n<p>Our lab has identified dozens of novel SBD genes using WES/WGS in consanguineous SBD families. Importantly, the genes that we and others have identified in these unique families are then used to advance diagnosis in pediatric SBDs around the world. We have built an enormous cohort of SBD families, including newly recruited families not yet studied genetically, and previous families that were negative for cause following WES analysis. Here we propose to collaborate with the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (X01) to have sequencing performed in individuals from a total of 200 families with genetically undiagnosed SBDs. The Gleeson Lab team of researchers is dedicated to the field of SBDs, with an outstanding track record of high-impact science, and a collaborative approach to discovery. We have 150 newly recruited families that we propose to study by WES by sequencing blood-derived DNA from two affected patients, or the parents and one affected patient. We also have 50 families in which WES was negative, which we propose to study in a multi-omics approach combining WGS from blood-derived DNA. We anticipate that this study will lead to the identification of many new molecular causes of SBDs, as well as uncover new genotype-phenotype correlations and new disease mechanisms, paving the way for future breakthroughs in detection, treatment and prevention.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Myelomeningocele (aka meningomyelocele, MM) is the most severe form of spina bifida, a neural tube defect (NTD) in humans and the most common CNS birth defect. MM is considered a genetically complex disease, and occurs in 3.72/10,000 live US birth, and is partly preventable with prenatal folate, but the genetic basis and the mechanisms by which folate work to reduce disease incidence remain obscure. MM is associated nearly uniformly with prenatal hydrocephalus and the Arnold-Chiari malformation, as well as paraplegia and lifelong neuromotor disability. The genes for several rare syndromic forms of NTDs are known, but the causes for the majority with sporadic MM remain unknown.</p>\n<p>Despite the importance of MM, most previous research has been limited to targeted sequencing and association studies of folate metabolism genes, or very small-scale exome sequencing. We hypothesize that de novo mutations (DNMs) produce likely gene disrupting (LGD) events that contribution to MM risk. Using conservative estimates of between 50-100 recurrently mutated discoverable genes contributing to risk, and our preliminary data demonstrating an excess of LGD DNMs in MM compared with control individuals, we estimate that with a cohort size of 1000 trios, we should uncover between 5-20 new recurrently mutated genes underlying MM, with minimal false-discovery. With this in mind, we formed the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium, and established a platform for data and sample sharing. Preliminary analysis of our first batch of 100 trios analyzed by WGS from GMKF suggests a wealth of important gene mutations. We have embarked on a new recruitment effort of an additional cohort of 400 new simplex MM trios, in collaboration with the US Spina Bifida Association, consented trios to allow for data sharing, and have performed detailed sample quality control. We also have preliminary data that use of dried bloodspot DNA from trios performs comparably to whole blood DNA, so will be happy to swap saliva for bloodspot recruitment at NIH’s preference. This cohort is now half-way assembled, with the remaining cohort to be ascertained in the next 6 months. We have established a workflow for de novo SNP/INDEL/SV detection from WGS and have ample computer storage and nodes to see the project to completion. We also plan to continue recruitment into the future with the goal of 2000 trios in the next 5 years. We propose a detailed bioinformatics workflow to identify gene mutations within a statistical framework, considering detailed scRNA expression profiling from developing mammalian neural tube, and have developed a robust functional validation workflow using Xenopus and mouse gene targeting. Our project has the potential to uncover a host of causes for this most common of the CNS birth defects, paving the way for future breakthroughs in detection, treatment, and prevention.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Chromosome abnormalities are a common cause of structural birth defects. Both childhood cancers and structural birth defects are critical and costly conditions associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the underlying genetic etiology of these diseases has the potential to profoundly improve preventative measures, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions.However, because these genomic copy number changes involve multiple genes and because most of these conditions are individually rare, defining the specific causative genes behind specific phenotypes has been a challenge. We met that challenge by spending the last 28 years enrolling and evaluating anyone with a chromosome 18 abnormality.</p>\n<p>The cohort now includes over 700 individuals with a wide variety of chromosome 18 copy number changes (CNV), as well as their parents. Because the vast majority of these participants have individually unique CNVs, we have been able to perform extensive genotype-phenotype correlations resulting in 58 publications. Of the 263 genes on chromosome 18, 28 are linked to specific hemizygous phenotypes. However, most have low penetrance. Genomic sequence data could identify variants in the extant allele that are hypermorphic and compensate for hemizygosity, or are hypomorphic and exacerbate hemizygosity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are phenotypes within this cohort that are rare, or an extreme version of one of the more common phenotypes. Genomic sequence data could help discover new biallelic conditions by revealing functional sequence variants of the extant allele. In both of these cases, there could also be variants in other genes on other chromosomes that may be associated with the phenotype that confer susceptibility or resilience. Inclusion of this unique cohort in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program can advance the goals of the program in several ways. First, by adding known susceptibility loci to the existing Kids First cohorts for the structural birth defects that are also found in our cohort. Second, for those structural birth defects known to be polygenetic, this cohort has a single defined risk factor which can simplify the search for secondary factors. Third, these studies can also bring clarity to people with chromosome 18 conditions and help to make the genotype more accurately predict phenotype. This approach could be a model for understanding the many other rare chromosome abnormalities which collectively are a common cause of structural birth defects.</p>",
